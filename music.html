  <h2>Musical Parodies</h2>
  <p>My two great passions in life are music and technology. And I like to make people laugh. So I take great songs – songs
      I love, songs that are fun to play and fun to sing along and dance to – and I replace the lyrics with daft
      jokes about software development. Then I make videos of them. Then I go along to conferences with my Steinberger
      travel guitar, rope in a couple of other tech folks who are musically inclined, and perform them live on stage - check
      out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLw0jj21rhfkM-etwRXGDIko0Ou-QLdeMq">Dylan Beattie and the
          Linebreakers - Live at NDC Oslo 2019</a>
