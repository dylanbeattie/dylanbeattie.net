    <h1>US Election 2020 Crossword: Solution</h1>
    <p>If you want to try the puzzle before reading this, you can <a href="us-election-2020-crossword">find it here</a>
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>In 1996, the New York Times ran an <a
            href="https://www.crosswordunclued.com/2009/01/nyt-election-day-crossword.html">ingenious crossword
            puzzle</a> on the day of the US presidential election - a puzzle with two valid solutions. The clue to
        39A was "Lead story in tomorrow's newspaper" with the answer being either CLINTON ELECTED or BOB DOLE ELECTED.
    </p>
    <p>
        This style of puzzle, where two valid solutions exist but the correct one depends on something you won't known
        until later, is known as a <em>Schrödinger puzzle</em>, after <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger%27s_cat">Erwin Schrödinger's famous thought
            experiment</a>
        about a cat that is both alive and dead until you open the box. I was reminded of the NYT puzzle a few weeks ago
        and realized that with BIDEN challenging TRUMP for the US presidency, this would be a nice opportunity to
        try setting a Schrödinger puzzle of my own.

    <h4>Special Solutions</h4>
    <p>As you probably figured out, it all hinges on 27a - "US election winner" - with the rest of the 
        double-solution clues based on whatever was entered at 27a. Where a clue includes wordplay, it 
        should work equally well for both solutions.</p>

            Prime
            Minister), anagram ("crazy") to yield solution.

            As for "27a's probably paid for a few pairs"... I'm sure Joe Biden has bought a few pairs
            of boots in his time... and if 27a is TRUMP, you can figure it out.

            Swinging left and right = YAWING, around point - either P, or N (compass point north). If 27a is TRUMP,
            it's YAWNING, a reference to the Trump campaign calling their opponent "Sleepy" Joe Biden. If 27a is BIDEN,
            it's YAWPING - "to talk loudly, raucously, or coarsely; loud or coarse talk or utterance."
