### Lyrics  

Trying to keep track of a username  
Seventeen calls to a hidden page IFRAME  
I'm trying to keep track of a username  
So everything goes in a trace like this  
And everyone knows it's always been a mess  
  
We're not even close to replacing this  
So everything goes in a trace like this  
Now it's all down, now it's all down tonight  
Never thought I'd see a cookie crash a whole website  
  
Well, somebody told me the user provider  
should use an adaptor to proxy the query factory builder  
Don't give me a lecture, it's your architecture,  
  
Eighty controllers, a hundred views  
Check the console, turns out none of them are used  
  
And we're not even close to replacing this  
I said we're not even close to replacing this  
Now it's all down, now it's all down tonight  
Never thought I'd see a cookie crash a whole website  
  
Well, somebody told me the user provider  
should use an adaptor to proxy the query factory builder  
Don't give me a lecture, it's your architecture,  
a taking it, taking it down  
  
Tables with no keys  
Behind repositories  
And yet still somehow  
No-one ever questions why...  
  
Well, somebody told me the user provider  
should use an adaptor to proxy the query factory builder  
Don't give me a lecture, it's your architecture,  
a taking it, taking it down  
  
Well, somebody told me the user provider  
should use an adaptor to proxy the query factory builder  
Don't give me a lecture, it's your architecture,  
a taking it, taking it down  
  
Well, somebody told me the user provider  
should use an adaptor to proxy the query factory builder  
Don't give me a lecture, it's your architecture,  
a taking it, taking it down
