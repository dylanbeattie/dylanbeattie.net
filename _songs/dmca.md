I probably had the idea for this one about ten seconds after I first heard of the Digital Millenium Copyright Act. A little nostagia trip for everyone who remembers alt.binaries, Napster, Limewire, Kazaa, AudioGalaxy... ah, good times.  
  
### Lyrics  
  
Young man, there's no need to feel down,    
I said, young man, you've been browsing around,    
I said, young man, what's that website you've found,  
With those hi-def movie downloads,  
  
Young man, look at all of those files,  
I said, young man, you'll be here for a while,  
You can download, anything you desire,  
Till your router catches fire,  
  
#### CHORUS:  

Youâ€™re violating the D M C A , violating the D M C A,  
They got everything, you can find it online, you can download it any time  
By violating the D M C A, violating the D M C A,  
All the new DVDs, special interest movies, even Taylor Swift MP3s,  
  
Young man, well you couldn't resist,  
I said young man, now your name's on a list,  
I said, young man, got your cease and desist,  
But you got to know this one thing,  
  
No man, ever serves any time,  
I said young man, maybe you'll pay a fine,   
And tomorrow, you will be back online,  
You'll be downloading day and night,  
  
CHORUS  
  
Young man, back when I was your age,  
It was usenet, not a link on a page,  
alt dot binaries, it was where we could go,  
If we wanted things to download,  
  
Napster, came along with a splash,  
Record labels, scared of losing their cash,  
Got it shut down, by the D M C A,  
So we moved to the Pirate Bay
