How do you make a concert video when your singer's in Kansas City, your guitar player is in Antwerp, your keyboard player's in Oslo, you and your bass player are on opposite sides of London and nobody's allowed to travel anywhere?

Turns out the answer is... green fabric. Lots of it. And, like anything you're doing for the first time, it's absolutely full of little details that would have been trivial to fix if we'd known about them in advance. I wish at the start of every clip I got everyone to clap and then stand still for a few bars to get all the different audio tracks to sync up - and if you look closely you'll notice a few random patches of people's floors where we were using greenscreens that didn't extend across the ground... but hey, we know for next time. 

Oh, and if you're glad to see us finally doing something that isn't more 80s rock... you got [Heather](https://twitter.com/quorralyne) to thank for that :)  

### Lyrics  

Life is like a hurricane, here in tech world,  
Deadlines, roadmaps, e-campaigns,  
All those tech nerds,  
Chasing that bonus,  
Act like they own us,

Tech sales!  
Every day they're out there making tech sales!  
Signing up and lining up train wreck sales!  

When it seems they're headed for that final contract,  
Shady wording never fails, devs remain trapped,  
The worst of messes,  
They call successes!  

Tech sales!  
Every day they're out there making tech sales!  
Signing up and lining up train wreck sales!  

C-c-c-commission! Global markets!
They're on a mission, hit those targets!
That's the reason they got into tech sales

Tech sales!  
Every day they're out there making tech sales!  
Signing up and lining up train wreck sales!
