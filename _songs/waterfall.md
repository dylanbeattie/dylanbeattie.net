A lot of songs grow from a single line... this one was me listening to 'The Wall' on the way home from a meetup where somebody talked about working for a massive finance company who were still using manual merge tools in their release process, and 'we don't use no source control' just sort of popped into my head and it grew from there.

### Lyrics  

We don't test our integrations  
We don't use no source control  
We can't deploy things to production  
We check our email, then go home  
Hey! Coders! Email and go home!  

All in all it's just an...  
Enterprise waterfall
