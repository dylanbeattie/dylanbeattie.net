The line in the video intro - 'Your files are exactly where you left them' - is a literal direct quote
from one of Microsoft's Windows 10 mandatory updates. Like most of you, it scared the bejabers out of 
me when I switched my PC on and was informed by Windows that my files were exactly where I left them...

A riff about updates. Firmware updates, forced updates, patches, switching your phone on in the morning
and discovering it's been updated in the night and now you can't find anything.

Music was done entirely by me in Logic Pro X. The original Pet Shop Boys track was produced by [Trevor Horn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trevor_Horn), one of the all-time great producers and studio engineers, and used all sorts of amazing 80s music tech like the Fairlight CMI, the Linn Drum and the Synclavier. My version isn't perfect, but I'm pretty happy with how it came out.

### Lyrics  

My laptop upgrades to Windows 10  
Connect to my phone, but now it's incompatible  
Read all the news about the IoT,  
Turns out that 10.3 can cause connection dropping  
Update my phone, my tablet and my car,  
If you can't take the pace, get out of the race,  
I'm sure it wasn't this way, back in the good old days,  
I'm not stuck in the past, I'm just reverse compatible  

#### CHORUS:  

System updates: mandatory,  
On my laptop, my TV, and my phone  
But these are my own devices, leave them alone  
  
Buy a new game, decide to have some fun,  
The only catch is there's a 10Gb patch  
I'd like to play now, but I can't see how,  
So I poke at some code while I watch it load  
  
I was a lonely boy, no friends, no toys  
In a world of my own, with a dial-up modem  
Yes, my grades were a mess, but on the BBS,  
I was always online, I was a system admin  
  
CHORUS  
  
I was faced with a choice at a critical stage  
Do we delay the release and face the shareholders' rage?  
But in the back of my head, I knew the bugs could wait,  
We could deal with them later in an app update  
  
It's not a crime when you miss a thing or two,  
A unit test, a code review  
You're still at work, it's late at night,  
Do you get it done, or get it right?  
Turn off your PC, too tired to cook,  
Poke at your phone, click some food  
Who cares if the code is looking 5x5,  
We can fix it with an update after we go live  
  
CHORUS
