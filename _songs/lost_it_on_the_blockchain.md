Some parodies start with a line, some start with an idea for a topic, but this one started with the original song. There's 
an [amazing video on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87FjkqtK67o) of the isolated vocal track from Marvin Gaye's recording of 'I Heard It Through The Grapevine', which I had stuck in my head for weeks â€“ although the version I ended up doing owes a lot more to [Creedence Clearwater Revival's version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCCfc2vAuDU) than it does to Marvin Gaye's version.

This isn't a proper live recording - the live video here was shot at the [Build Stuff](https://www.buildstuff.lt/) conference party in Vilnius, Lithuania in November 2019, and the music has been overdubbed 'cos the original recording looks fantastic but we didn't get a proper feed from the mixing desk so the audio was from the camcorder mic and didn't sound great. 

Thanks to the Build Stuff crew for hosting us, recording the show and letting us use the footage. <3

(And yes. [Dogecoin](https://dogecoin.com/) really is [dog-based internet money](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dogecoin).)

### Lyrics 

I bet you're wondering all about  
This new currency that's coming out  
And I can't deny the possibility  
That it could mean profitability  
I did all the work and I shared the proof  
But now my power bill is through the roof  
  
Ooh yeah, I lost it on the blockchain  
My money's never coming back again  
Ooh yeah, I lost it on the blockchain  
Watched my savings going down the drain,  
Money money, yeah.  
  
It seemed too good to be true,  
I heard about it from this guy I knew  
Who told me all about the crypto code  
Behind the dark web and the Silk Road  
I signed up online, put in all of my cash  
Nobody told me it was going to crash  
  
CHORUS  
  
I divested my portfolio  
Bitcoin, Ethereum and Monero  
I was going to stick it to the man  
But now I'm living in the back of my van,  
I even bought some dogecoin, oh yeah, honey,  
Don't you know that's dog-based internet money?  
  
CHORUS  
  
SOLO  
  
CHORUS
