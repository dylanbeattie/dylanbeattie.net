    as webmaster, then IT Manager and then systems architect at [Spotlight](https://www.spotlight.com),
    where his first-hand experience of watching an organisation and its codebase
    evolve over more than a decade provided him with a unique insight into how 
    everything from web standards and API design to Conway's Law and recruitment 
    ends up influencing a company’s code and culture.

    As well as his work with Skills Matter, he runs the [London .NET User Group](https://twitter.com/LondonDotNet),
