Imagine we have a bunch of people who want to go to Cairo. They find a pilot who's prepared to fly them there - he doesn't have any formal flying qualifications but he's flown, like, loads of times and not killed anyone yet. They get hold of a plane from somewhere - they don't have budget for a 'proper' aeroplane, but they know a guy who knows a guy who can lend them a plane that he reckons will do the job. There's no air traffic control, so when they're ready to go they just get on the plane, open the throttles and off they go.

And when the plane crashes and kills everybody on board, it's clearly the pilot's fault, right? 

This is pretty much how commercial aviation worked until the mid 1930s. And it's frighteningly reminiscent of how a lot of software development happens today.
