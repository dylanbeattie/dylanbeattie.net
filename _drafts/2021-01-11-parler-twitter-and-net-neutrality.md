It's been an interesting week for the web. Donald Trump, the 45th President of the United States of America, has been permanently suspended from Twitter. Parler -- the social networking platform that was gaining popularity with conservatives, Republicans, and various other individuals who found themselves on the wrong side of Twitter's acceptable use policy -- has been effectively shut down by multiple hosting platforms and providers saying they are no longer prepared to do business with Parler. They've even been dropped as a client by their own lawyers. This has, understandably, provoked a great deal of debate and discussion regarding free speech, censorship, and the question of net neutrality.

Here's where I stand on the whole thing. First, my reaction to Donald Trump being removed from Twitter was pure, unbridled joy. I love Twitter. I've been an enthusiastic Twitter user for over a decade; my personal experience of that platform has been overwhelmingly positive, and I couldn't begin to count the number of friendships, collaborations and professional connections that I've made thanks to Twitter. Despite this, I have always found Twitter's position regarding individuals like Donald Trump deeply problematic. The argument that world leaders are exempt from regulations around divisive language and hate speech because it is "in the public interest" doesn't work for me; I believe the public interest is better served by relying on good old fashioned journalism when it comes to reporting on the opinions and statements of elected leaders. I find Twitter without Mr. Trump's toxic presence to be a happier, healthier place. 

The question has come up time and again, though: "how can you support net neutrality while simultaneously saying it's OK to remove people from Twitter"?

Let's start with net neutrality. Fundamentally, this is the idea that your internet service provider (ISP) must treat all traffic equally. They can not, and must not, prioritise specific kinds of internet traffic. Consider the oft-cited example of somebody whose home internet connection is provided by a media company like Comcast or Virgin Media. Without net neutrality, Virgin Media would be allowed to prioritise traffic associated with their own streaming media services, and to throttle or block network traffic from competing media companies like Netflix. Netflix sucks because Virgin Media is throttling their traffic; Virgin Media customers begin cancelling their Netflix subscriptions because the quality is inferior, and there is nothing Netflix can do about this.

An internet without net neutrality would be like a road network where car manufacturers were allowed to own roads, and to enforce traffic laws and rights of way depending on whether you chose to drive one of their cars or a competitor's car. Imagine trying to be the next Tesla in a country where General Motors decides which cars are allowed to use the freeways. It's easy to see how this would stifle competition and very quickly lead to monopolies. Net neutrality is that stops this happening on the internet, and I believe it is an absolutely vital component of a free and fair digital economy.

So there's our first principle: internet providers have to carry all
