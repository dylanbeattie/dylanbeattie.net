In 1991, I went on a school trip to Paris. 50-odd British teenagers travelling from Bristol to Paris by coach, to spend two extremely packed days going around museums and monuments. As you can probably guess, our group weren’t exactly connoisseurs of French art and architecture, but there were two attractions on our itinerary that absolutely everybody had heard of - the Eiffel Tower, and the Mona Lisa.

The Louvre was actually pretty interesting, but the star exhibit, *La Gioconda*, was… underwhelming, to say the least. I don’t mean the picture, I mean the object. 80x50cm of muted, earthy tones, about the size of a movie poster, viewed from three metres away, behind a security rope, through a thick sheet of bulletproof glass. If you actually wanted to look at the painting, the prints on sale in the gift shop provided a vastly superior viewing experience. If you want to see that famously enigmatic half-smile right now, there’s a [90 megapixel scan of her up on Wikimedia Commons](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b1/Mona_Lisa%2C_by_Leonardo_da_Vinci%2C_from_C2RMF.jpg) that’s so detailed you can see the individual brush strokes – not to mention every tear and crack in the 500-year-old canvas.

The Mona Lisa is probably the single most valuable painting in history – while it’s extremely unlikely that it would ever be offered for sale, Guinness World Records lists it as having the highest ever insurance value for a painting; US$100 million in 1962, which would make it worth around US$900 million today, accounting for inflation. But the Mona Lisa is also in the public domain; any copyright that might have existed when it was painted expired centuries ago. You can download that scan from Wikimedia, have it printed onto white poplar board, frame it, and hang it in your house. There is even [legal precedent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridgeman_Art_Library_v._Corel_Corp.) that accurate photographs of public domain artworks are automatically also in the public domain – if the purpose of a photograph is to capture an existing painting as accurately as possible, the photograph itself cannot be considered an original work. That image can be printed, sold, parodied, reproduced, modified, given away, without any restrictions whatsoever.

It turns out reproductions of the Mona Lisa have been in demand for a while - there are numerous copies dating from the 16th and 17th century, most of which are valuable works of art in their own right despite varying significantly from the original. And although within the last few decades we’ve developed the technology to create pixel-perfect digital renditions of the Mona Lisa, they’re still clearly copies – they might be exquisitely detailed photographs of the strokes of Leonardo’s brush, but they’re not Leonardo’s actual brush strokes.

Right, time to do a thought experiment. Let’s get all *Star Trek* and invent the replicator. Don’t worry too much about the details; just assume that we now have a way to create perfect copies of real objects. 100%, perfect, down to the molecule, completely indistinguishable from the real thing. In fact, they’re copies so accurate that talking about the “real thing” starts to get a little complicated, and that leaves us with two options. One option would be that we just say the hell with it. Publish the replicator patterns online. You get a Mona Lisa, you get a Mona Lisa, everybody gets a Mona Lisa. They’re all priceless, they’re all worthless. 

Or… we all agree that the one in the Louvre is the real thing, because *that’s the one in the Louvre*. That’s the one that was painted by Leonardo in 1507, that was acquired by King Francis I, that’s been on display in Paris since 1797. The fact there are countless physically identical replicas around the world makes no difference; only this one is the real deal, and we know it is, because the Louvre are generally pretty reliable when it comes to knowing where their priceless artworks are from one day to the next.

Enter [Charlie Mortdecai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortdecai), the infamous art dealer and occasional thief. Mortdecai suddenly pops up one morning and announces to the world that he has pulled off the crime of the century - he’s switched the paintings. The one hanging in the Louvre is now a replicated copy, and the one hanging in his London apartment is the real one. The French authorities deny any such crime took place, but Mortdecai produces what appears to be some very convincing footage of Jock, his thuggish manservant, deftly disabling the alarm system, removing the original painting and replacing it with a replica. Mortdecai hands himself in to the police, complete with a few dozen witnesses who are prepared to testify under oath that they helped him steal the painting – but, since the Louvre are adamant that no theft has taken place, there are no charges to press.

There is, of course, no point asking experts to examine the paintings to determine which is a fake. The whole notion of forgery has lost all meaning here; if physical objects can be replicated with absolutely accuracy, down to the very molecule, questions like “which one is the fake” become completely meaningless. The question of which one is the “real” Mona Lisa becomes a question of who you believe - the Louvre, or Mortdecai? Except that’s now a billion dollar question – because the “real” Mona Lisa is the most expensive work of art in history, and the other is just a molecular replica with no historic significance.

So, faced with what is, let’s face it, a bit of an existential pickle, the Louvre does something unprecedented: the museum purchases the Mortdecai Mona Lisa for half a billion dollars, claiming it represents a “historically significant forgery.” Mortdecai’s painting is shipped back to Paris, and the following morning, the Mona Lisa is on display, smiling her enigmatic half-smile, and the Louvre announce they have a brilliant solution to prevent it ever happening again. They have registered their ownership of the Mona Lisa by taking a copy of the “molecular blueprint” used by the replicators, turning that into a digital file, and publishing this file on a blockchain ledger. That’s the Mona Lisa now.  of anybody else claiming to have “stolen” the original La Gioconda, the blockchain can be used by any interested party to determine that, yes, the Louvre still owns it, and ownership has not been transferred to anybody else.

A week later, very excited by all this talk of blockchains and cryptographic ledgers, Elon Musk offers the Louvre five billion dollars for the Mona Lisa, because he wants to launch it into space on a rocket and then blow it up. Our friends at the Louvre realise that with five billion dollars they can probably buy a whole lot of food and medicines for homeless people, and hey, if anybody *really* wants to see the Mona Lisa, they’ve got the Mortdecai replica on display in the café, so they accept Elon’s offer. A new transaction is logged on the blockchain, confirming to the entire world that Elon Musk now owns *the* Mona Lisa. And, incidentally, consuming a few hundred kilowatt-hours of electricity, which is enough to run a small family home for two months, but hey, crypto, right?

But when the Louvre’s people contact Elon to arrange shipping, he laughs! He already has a Mona Lisa! And, because of the blockchain ledger, *his* is the real one. Right? It’s identical, down to the molecule, to the one the Louvre has, but the ledger says Elon Musk owns the real Mona Lisa… *ergo*, the Mona Lisa currently in Elon’s possession must be the real one.

The Louvre people give up, bemused, and settle down for a nice glass of Bordeaux and a long, contemplative look at the Mona Lisa that’s still hanging on the wall, despite the fact they apparently don’t own it any more. Elon puts the Mona Lisa on his latest SpaceX Falcon, launches it into space, and true to his word, blows it up.

The next day, he lists it for sale. Jeff Bezos offers ten billion dollars. Elon accepts. Boom. He just made a five billion dollar profit, which more than pays for the fuel used to launch the rocket. A transaction is logged on the blockchain, recording that Jeff Bezos is now the owner of the Mona Lisa. Which, obviously, means the replica that’s hanging in Jeff’s office is now the real one. (Right?) But, y’know, Jeff never really liked that picture much. He donates it to the Louvre - complete with a transfer of ownership on the blockchain ledger - and buys nyancat.gif for a very reasonable US$600,000 instead. And, being a man who knows a thing or two about sending parcels, Jeff ships it to Paris. Which means the Louvre now has three identical Mona Lisas – not to mention access to the replicator, allowing them to create as many more as they like – and, of course, the blockchain ledger says the Louvre owns the real one. Whatever that means.

If you’re scratching your head at this point and trying to work out exactly what the hell I’m talking about, then congratulations, and welcome to the completely bizarre idea of **non-fungible tokens** - NFTs. A cryptographically secure method for creating digital things that can’t be copied. Well, except they *can*, but we’ve all kind of agreed that the copies don’t count.

OK, let’s recap:

### Blockchains and Cryptocurrencies: a recap

Say it’s 2010, and I want to buy some Kinder Eggs. Problem is, Kinder Eggs are illegal where I live – illegal to buy, illegal to sell. But I know a guy downtown; $50 cash gets you an egg, no questions asked. I don’t know who he is. He doesn’t know who I am. He starts the day with a box of eggs, ends the day with an empty box and a fat sack of cash. No records, no paper trail, no way to connect me to him.

Then I find out about these super awesome limited edition Kinder Eggs you can get in Malawi. There’s a guy claims he can ship them to me – but there’s a problem. I need to pay for them. If I use my Visa card, bam, there’s a paper trail linking me to the supplier. Not to mention most black market Kinder Egg dealers aren’t set up to take Visa. Paypal? Same problem – it’s linked to email addresses and real cards.

But… what if we had magic beans, and magic bags? Everybody can see how MUCH is in them, but nobody knows who they belong to. I know which wallet is mine, so I can say to the Magic Internet Wallet System “please move 200 magic beans from my wallet into wallet #17” - and now my wallet is down 200 beans, and wallet #17 is up 200 beans. But if I just say “put 200 magic beans into MY wallet”, the Magic Wallet System says “no, you can’t do that - the magic beans have to come from somewhere.” Turns out there are only two ways to get beans into my wallet. One is to donate some computer time to the whole magic internet wallet system – the other is to find somebody who already has some, and offer them an exchange. Maybe they’ll give you magic beans in exchange for pizza? Or a back massage? Or, hey, maybe you can just give them money, and in exchange they’ll transfer some of their magic beans into your internet wallet. 

Of course, the wallets don’t exist, and the beans don’t exist. They’re just entries in a big database – a special kind of database that you can’t edit. Nobody can edit it. Nobody can delete records, nobody can change existing records; all it’s possible to do is add new ones. 







Let’s recap a bit, and talk about scarcity. Real things are scarce. We can’t copy and paste bananas and bicycles. There are only so many 1959 Gibson Les Paul guitars in the world – we can’t make any more because it isn’t 1959 any more, we can’t replicate them (yet!), and so those original 1959 Les Pauls have value. Enormous value. This makes them sought-after by investors, and creates a market for fakes and forgeries – but also for replicas and licensed copies, for all those of us who hanker after the real thing but will settle for a contemporary replica in the meantime.

But digital things? We can make an almost infinite number of perfect copies – and we do! The web couldn’t even function without trivially cheap copies. When a GIF appears on the front page of Reddit, countless millions of copies of that GIF are created - the copy that you see on your screen is a replica of the copy stored in your phones’ memory, which is a perfect replica of the copy stored on Reddit’s own servers, which is in turns a perfect replica of the one uploaded by the original poster. Countless, pixel-perfect replicas, created using technology that we’ve perfected over decades to do exactly that - make perfect copies of digital things. And, of course, as soon as you scroll away or switch to a different app, those copies vanish; they’re destroyed as easily as they’re created.

This creates headaches for anybody who profits from scarcity. Let’s talk for a moment about artists, creators, people who are still alive, working in physical media, creating physical objects. Paintings, sculptures, *objets d’art* in oil and ceramic and glass. They create them, they sell them, they create more. You want to own the actual original painting? There’s only one. Our Star Trek replicator doesn’t exist yet. That painting will cost you hundreds, maybe thousands. You want to own a print? Most artists will issue limited edition print runs - a few hundred high-quality reproductions, numbered and signed by the artist. Scarce, physical, tangible objects. 

But if you create digital artworks – videos, JPEGs, GIFs; maybe we even consider tweets as a form of artwork? – no such scarcity exists. The second you share your art with the world by posting it online, those pixel-perfect replicas are already happening. They have to - the only way anybody can see your art is to copy it; from your computer, to a server, to a content distribution network, and eventually to the memory and the screen of the person viewing it. This is why when you sign up to a service such as Facebook, you accept the terms and conditions, which includes this clause:

> Specifically, when you share, post, or upload content that is covered by intellectual property rights on or in connection with our Products, you grant us a non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free, and worldwide license to host, use, distribute, modify, run, copy, publicly perform or display, translate, and create derivative works of your content (consistent with your [privacy](https://www.facebook.com/help/325807937506242?ref=tos) and [application](https://www.facebook.com/help/1727608884153160?ref=tos) settings). This means, for example, that if you share a photo on Facebook, you give us permission to store, copy, and share it with others (again, consistent with your settings) such as service providers that support our service or other Facebook Products you use. This license will end when your content is deleted from our systems.

Sure, you can publish low-res versions of your artwork. Keep the original Illustrator file, and publish a 600x600 watermarked JPEG on Instagram to show people what you’re selling; invite people to pay $75 for a high-quality 6000x6000 PNG version. And hope they don’t put that PNG on their website, or publish it on Facebook, or share it on the Pirate Bay. Fundamentally, though, people can copy your art, because all of us now live in a world full of devices that are really, really good at making bit-perfect copies of digital things as fast as they possibly can.



But, let’s go back to talking about art. The kind of people who buy art at Sotheby’s and Christie’s do it for bragging rights, and because it’s going to go up. Here’s “Untitled”, painted by Mark Rothko in 1967. It was sold at auction by Christie’s in New York last year for US$31.3 million. 



The obvious question, of course, is: does it even make any sense to want to own a GIF? Turns out the answer is yes. Not because you need to possess it to enjoy it, the way you would with a sculpture or a ‘59 Les Paul Standard. And not because of any kind of genuine scarcity - nobody’s buying Nyan Cat because they’re worried it’ll be gone and then they’ll never be able to *see* it again. No, it makes sense to own a GIF if you believe it will be worth more tomorrow – and, more importantly, if somebody else believes the same thing, and they might be prepared to buy it tomorrow for more money than you paid for it. And the only way to guarantee that when they want it they come to *you* is to create digital scarcity. To create something that you can have and nobody else can have, something that you can sell which nobody else can sell. And you can’t do that with GIFs, because they’re trivial to copy - but it turns out there is a way to do it, and that’s to create a non-fungible token; an NFT. A digital asset that can’t be replicated. Sometimes, the digital asset *is* the work of art - last month somebody “bought” Nyan Cat for US$590,000; they are now recorded as the registered owner of a cryptographic hash of Chris Torres’ original image. 

Sometimes, it’s just part of the package. $50 gets you the NFT edition of the new Kings of Leon album - including a digital download, “exclusive moving artwork”, and access to a limited edition vinyl pressing of the album. They’re on sale for two weeks – but after that, there’s no more new ones, and you can’t copy them, so they’ll form a sort of digital “collector’s edition”. Except the digital download is just a regular download, same as every other digital version of the album, and the limited edition vinyl pressing is a physical object that you can buy & sell like any other vinyl record - so the only thing here that’s cryptographically scarce is the NFT itself. You’re paying $50 for a download, an LP, and a magic token. Tomorrow somebody might give you $100 for the magic token. The band have said they’re offering VIP experiences, tickets and artwork to people who own a magic token. All the blockchain does is prove who owns that magic token; if you trust the parties involved to honour their commitment, then you get the VIP experiences and artwork and stuff. 

There’s a lot of buzz about NFT. NME has a big old article about the Kings of Leon album release, which ends with the quote “And with the exclusivity factor thrown in, they’re a great way to feel as though your music is actually *yours*.” Which, of course, is total crap. Paying $50 for an NFT doesn’t mean you own the music – Kings of Leon own the music; all you get is a licence to listen to it. 

But… just ‘cos that won’t work with the new Kings of Leon album doesn’t mean it wouldn’t work for a composer creating music for hire. Or for artists selling original artwork to somebody who wants to use that artwork on T-shirts, mugs, other print-on-demand products, as a way of verifying proof of ownership - but also as a way of letting that customer sell on those rights to exactly one person.
