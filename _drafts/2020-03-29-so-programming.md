This post was actually inspired by an email I received last week, from somebody who watched the video of my "The Art of Code" presentation and emailed me to say "hey, you clearly love computers, any tips for somebody who hates their job and wants to become a developer?"

There are so many options out there at the moment that trying to work out where to begin can be overwhelming. There's boot camps and online tutorials and books and videos and courses and and and and... so how do you know where to start?

Well, when I talk to folks who want to learn to play the guitar, I always tell them the same thing: don't think of it like that. Talk to any of the world's greatest guitar players and they'll all tell you that, even after decades of playing for hours every single day, they're still learning. If your definition of success is "can I play the guitar: yes or no", you're setting yourself up for failure, because none of us ever gets to that point.

So instead of that, learn a song. Pick one song that you know well, that you love, and learn to play that song. That first song will take a while - weeks, maybe months. Your fingers will hurt, you'll get discouraged, but keep at it. Because suddenly, one day, you'll be able to play that song. And then you pick another song. And once you've learned a few songs, you'll start noticing the patterns and similarities. If you want to, that's when you can start reading up on music theory and figuring out what those patterns mean. But if that's not your thing, no problem - just learn another song. And you'll get better, not just at playing, but you'll get faster at learning new songs. A couple of weeks, then a couple of days, then a couple of hours, then one day you'll be able to switch on the radio and hear a song you've never heard before and by the second chorus you've figured out the key and the chords and you're playing along to it with a big stupid grin on your face.

Programming's the same. If you're starting from scratch, you could spend years learning theory and patterns and principles and never actually create anything - or you can set yourself a goal, and work out how to achieve it. Like guitar players, good programmers know they're never done; there's always more to learn, but you don't need to know *everything* to create something valuable.

To build real applications you can share with the rest of the world, I think you need to understand three key concepts - what we call "front end", "back end" and "storage".

#### Front End: How to make web pages

The web is built on three different languages. 

1. Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) controls the structure of a web page. At its most basic, HTML is how you turn a wall of plain text into something with headings, paragraphs, bullet points and images.
2. Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is how we control the **appearance** of those web pages, starting with simple things like changing the font and the colour of your headings.
3. JavaScript (JS) is how we add behaviour to our web pages; making things move, appear, disappear. You can build a perfectly usable website without using any JavaScript at all, but it's useful to understand where it fits into the big picture

Find a page in a magazine and try to recreate it using HTML and CSS.
