How long is a long time? How long does it take for the novelty to wear off and the new thing become the normal thing? For me, the magic number has always been three months. Not exactly, but thereabouts. Early on in my career as a developer, three months was a sort of complexity threshold - I worked for a small web agency that built bespoke e-commerce sites for clients. Projects that could be completed by one developer in three months tended to be successful; anything that went on longer than that would start to feel like a death march. Here in the UK, our academic year starts in September... those first three months at a new school or new university, from the start of term until you break for Christmas, are when everything feels novel and unfamiliar and strange... when you get back after the Christmas break, it's just normal.

I'm thinking about this a lot, because at the moment, this strange lifestyle that's been forced onto all of us feels very temporary. In the vanishingly unlikely event that the COVID-19 crisis was resolved tomorrow, most of us would just go back to business as usual. Back to the office, back to school, back to the pub. But the longer this goes on, the more likely it is that some of these changes will be permanent. And I think that magic number, three months, is the key.

Right now, I'm working with various companies to help them virtualise their tech conferences and user groups - but the focus is overwhelmingly on taking events that were already scheduled for April, May and June, and figuring out how to run them online, with the unspoken assumption being that by the autumn we'll be back to running physical events and attending and speaking in person. Events that are scheduled for October and beyond are just sticking to the plan.
