You know what the worst feeling in the world is? I've been professionally screwed over before. It comes with the territory. There's a lot of bad people out there, and sometimes the spidey-sense doesn't figure out who they are in time.

No, the worst feeling in the world is that you've not just been screwed over: it's that you've been manipulated into helping screw over other people.

Let's talk about Modern Frontends Live.

In June this year, Gen Ashley contacted me via Twitter to ask if I'd like to speak and/or run a workshop at a new conference she was working on: Modern Frontends Live. I don't know Gen well, but I first met her sometime around 2010. I've spoken at a few of her meetups over the years, seen her around at various tech events. My assumption was that the organisers of Modern Frontends had hired Gen to handle speaker liaison because of her connections in the London tech community.

I submitted a workshop, and a talk -- actually a placeholder "to be confirmed" talk, because Gen explained they wanted to get speakers up on the website as soon as possible. What sort of numbers were they talking about, I asked? 25 workshops, 100+ speakers, 3000 attendees. That didn't seem unreasonable, given the calibre of speakers that were appearing on the website. The London Excel can easily handle an event on that scale. I included a note with my workshop submission saying we would need to discuss revenue sharing but that I'd normally expect my share to come to at least £150 per attendee per day. 

This is the end of June. Nothing happens. Total silence. 

**September 7th:** I notice that my talk and workshop are both published on their website without any acknowledgement or confirmation from the organisers. I contact them to ask what's going on; I have a call with Gen Ashley. She suggests a ticket price -- £899 early bird, £1099 full price. That's broadly in line with what I'd expect from an event on the scale they're talking about. Then Gen asks me if I'll donate my share of the workshop revenue to support her other event because it's a "non-profit".

Now, I do this for a living. For keynotes and private conferences, I charge a speaker fee. For public events, I make money by running workshops. I prepare all the material, and deliver the workshop training in person. The conference does all the sales and promotion, bar the odd Twitter or LinkedIn post from me, and we split the profits. 20 people at £1,000/day; deduct overheads for room hire, catering, my flights and hotel if that's a factor, and we share whatever is left.

October 31st, they asked me to "touch base" regarding my workshop. Turns out they'd sold three tickets.

For most events, three tickets would be immediate cancellation -- that wouldn't even be enough to cover travel expenses. But Modern Frontends was happening in London, where I live. I didn't need a flight or a hotel; the only overheads would be room hire and catering, so even with a small group the workshop should still bring in a bit of cash.

On Thursday November 10th, with one week to go, the agenda still hadn't been published -- which meant I knew I was speaking sometime on Thursday or Friday, but had no idea when. On that Thursday morning, all the speakers received an email saying the agenda would be published late on Thursday. Thursday came... Thursday went... no agenda.

Friday 11th, another email:

> Subject: SCHEDULE UPDATE
>
> Hi Dylan.
>
> We're having some technical issues with the platform we're using, so there's a bit of delay.
>
> We also have a team member had a death in the family, and that has affected us a bit. 
>
> **So bear with us!**

The schedule was finally announced on Sunday 13th November at 17:09pm.

My workshop was going ahead - two days of in-person training, Tuesday and Wednesday, 9am-5pm, in the "London Suite" at Excel - and my talk was scheduled for Thursday afternoon. OK. A little late, but OK.

Tuesday morning, I arrived. Couldn't find the London Suite. I asked the venue staff. They'd never heard of it. No signage. No mention anywhere of Modern Frontends Live. I eventually find it - it wasn't *quite* on display in a locked filing cabinet stuck in a disused lavatory with a sign on the door saying "Beware of the Leopard", but it wasn't far off. Of the 25+ workshops advertised on the website, mine is one of only two that is actually running.

There's no catering. No lounge, no break area, no coffee machine... we have the training room, and that's it. After half an hour Gen shows up with a tray of coffees that she's quite clearly just bought from a place upstairs. Shortly after that she shows up with bottles of water.

It's embarrassing. Considering how much the attendees have paid to attend the workshop, I'm absolutely mortified. The room we're in has no windows or natural light. Two more attendees join unexpectedly at 10am. They couldn't find the room either. But hey, no problem. We have plenty of space.

At points throughout the day I insist that we all take a break, stretch our legs, go for a walk around the block.

Lunch is Gen buying everybody sandwiches at one of the concession stands in Excel. She tells us that the venue is "too busy" to provide catering. (Folks, conference venues will never, EVER be "too busy" to provide catering... unless you don't give them enough notice, or decide you don't want to pay the prices they're asking.)

The workshop group is actually great: smart people, lots of really, really insightful questions. It's a lot of fun working with them. After we call it a day, Gen takes me to one side. She wants to know why people are saying nasty things on Twitter.

I explain, as politely as I can, that every single piece of communication and interaction I've had with the event has been shambolic. The emails, the schedule, the pricing, the sales, the lack of catering, the organisation -- and that if the other speakers' experience is anything comparable to mine, it's no wonder they're angry. I explain that I've spent the day working my *ass* off to ensure the folks in my workshop get value for money, and their organisation has been undermining me every step of the way. Gen is dismissive. She says that Twitter is not her problem and she needs to concentrate on running the event. I agree with her: for the rest of the week her job is to make sure all the people who actually show up have the best experience possible, but that if she ever wants to run another event again, if she ever wants another tech speaker to accept an invitation to one of her events, she will need to follow that up with a full public explanation and an apology. 

I think she thinks I'm joking. I'm not joking. I'm tired and fed up and starting to suspect I will never get paid.

Wednesday goes much the same -- except Excel is a lot busier; more events, more conferences, which means after Gen's paid for everybody's sandwiches, there are no tables free where we can sit and eat. We go back to our windowless training room.

There's a speaker dinner that evening. I didn't go; instead, I swung by Dylan Schiemann's HalfStack event which is taking place in Shoreditch -- and which I was originally planning to speak at until the Modern Frontends workshop opportunity came along. Sorry, Dylan. I should have stuck with you. HalfStack is in the back room of a bar in Shoreditch. It's welcoming and convivial; there's free drinks, and cake, and snacks, and pizza. I don't stay late. I have a conference talk tomorrow and I want to be well rested for it.

Thursday, I head along to the conference proper. It's embarrassing. The sponsor "booths" are tables in a hallway. There are a few hundred attendees; nothing close to the "3000 developers" advertised on the Modern Frontends website. Most of the rooms are laid out cabaret style. This is a trick venues use when turnout is way below expectations: put all the chairs around big dining tables, so the room looks "full" even if there's only a few dozen people in there.

My talk goes pretty well. Maybe 50 people show up to learn about ray-tracing and 3D computer graphics. The projector works, the sound works. I don't see a camera anywhere. I cannot comment on the so-called "live stream" or the controversy about virtual tickets. I didn't buy a virtual ticket, I never tried to access any streams. All I know is that there was no camera in the Ada Lovelace room where I was presenting my talk.

I didn't go back today. I couldn't face it. Modern Frontends wasn't just shambolic, it was downright depressing.

Gen Ashley was the only person I saw organising anything; she told me they had a "small team" but I didn't see or meet any of the others. This is on her.
