I'm an optimiser. I notice the inefficiencies and friction in the way life works, and I try to make it better. One of the areas where this has manifested over the last five years is in how I pack for travel; if you've seen me playing live with the Linebreakers any time recently, you might have noticed the aluminium flightcase that has all my guitar and audio gear in it, velcroed in place, permanently wired up - I can literally show up to a venue, plug in a mains power lead and a pair of stereo jacks, and be good to go.
