Have you ever been to one of those meetings where the agenda says **“14:00: Update from CEO (5 mins)”** – and then after half an hour, the CEO is still talking, the agenda’s completely torpedoed, and everyone is trying to work out whether they’re going to just skip everyone else’s update so they can wrap up at 3pm as scheduled, or the one-hour meeting is just going to drag on and on until it’s taken up most of the afternoon and that’s the day wiped out?

I have. And, yes, on a handful of occasions I’ve been the person doing the talking – sorry!. But sticking to an agenda when you’re talking is hard – like a lot of so-called “soft skills”, participating in meetings effectively is way harder than most people thing. Being able to plan and deliver a five-minute update in five minutes, or a half-hour presentation in exactly half an hour, is a skill that takes time and effort to improve.

So I built a thing that can help. It’s called Agenda Defender (https://agendadefender.app), and it can help you and your team keep your meetings on schedule.

First, type (or paste) your agenda. Local times, 24-hour clock, one line per item, with the finish time as the last entry.

Click “Let’s go!” and it’ll turn each agenda item into a live progress bar. And that’s it.

Now, bear in mind that one little web app is unlikely to fix dysfunctional communication styles overnight – if you work somewhere where long rambling meetings that wander all over the place are a regular occurrence, something like this might come as a bit of a shock. But if we’re going to improve, we really need two things – incentive, and corrective feedback. And once you’ve tried running meetings with Agenda Defender a few times, folks will get the hang of it – the live schedule will make it easier to pace yourself when you’re speaking, and the fact everybody can see who’s hitting their scheduled slots gives everybody an incentive to keep things on track. And if you do need to reschedule, or shuffle things around mid-meeting, no problem –  just edit the agenda and start again.
