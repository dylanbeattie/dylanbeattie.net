I write a lot. Conference talks, blog posts, articles, song lyrics, training material – almost everything I do starts off as words. Maybe the odd heading or bullet list, but mostly just a few thousand words in an Evernote document. For a long while, I've been looking for something that does for writing what Kindle does for reading. Something that's digital, connected, lightweight, syncs to the cloud, but doesn't feel like working on a computer. Specifically, something with an e-ink display I can use outdoors, in bright sunlight, that's built for working with text. 

I'm one of those people who vastly prefers typing to handwriting. I know devices like Remarkable have the most fantastic stylus support and people rave about how they feel just like using a pencil & paper... friends, I own many pencils, and an embarrassing collection of notepads, sketch pads and jotters, but when it comes to getting words out of my head and onto a page, give me a QWERTY keyboard every time. *(I recall reading that Neal Stephenson wrote all 5,000+ pages of the Baroque Cycle longhand using a fountain pen, and I get carpal tunnel syndrome just thinking about that.)*

I've owned every generation of Kindle, and loved them all dearly, but they're closed devices. They run an "experimental" web browser that's just about good enough to sign in to airport Wi-Fi if you're patient, but there's no filesystem access, no app store, no way to connect an external keyboard or install your favourite note-taking app. I first saw a Remarkable tablet a few years ago, and I was seriously impressed, but again, the closed platform was a deal-breaker. 

Last week, after a particularly bright and sunny day which I spent indoors, with the curtains drawn, because, dammit, I have work do to and every screen I own is so super-shiny and reflective, I asked on Twitter for any recommendations for an e-ink device that supported an external keyboard, and [Scott Hanselman](https://twitter.com/shanselman) pointed me to a [review he'd just done](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJWwlXS_cTM) comparing the reMarkable 2, the ONYX BOOX Note Air and the ONYX BOOX Nova 3. The ONYX BOOX Note Air (which I shall refer to hereafter as just the Onyx) looked like exactly what I was after, and, well, it's been a rough couple of weeks and buying gadgets is one of my coping mechanisms, so I ordered one from Amazon. I've been playing with it for a couple of days now and it's delightful.

### TL;DR:

* It's an e-ink tablet that runs full Android 10.0. Costs £420
* It's not Google "Play Protect" certified, so you need to jump through a few hoops to get the Google Play store on it.
* Most apps *run*, but whether they're usable or not is a bit of a crapshoot depending how well they handle the e-ink display.
* Bluetooth keyboards work just fine.
* Evernote works nicely.
* Battery lasts about 15 hours - that's using various apps, with Bluetooth and Wi-Fi enabled the whole time. A full charge takes  about 2 hours.
* The pen stylus works brilliantly on the built-in Notes app, but most third-party apps have too much display lag to use with handwriting.

### First Impressions

When you first open the box, it's clear ONYX has paid a lot of attention to first impressions. The packaging is seriously classy, the device itself looks amazing - 6mm thick, fantastic build quality, and the e-ink screen is stunning. It's crisp, it's smooth, it's perfectly even without any rogue bright spots.

> *This is the point where I should confess that this is the first Android device I have ever owned. I've run Windows, Linux, macOS, and multiple iPhones and iPads, but until today I've never actually owned a device that ran Android. So on one hand, I have absolutely no idea where anything is or how any of it works. But, on the other hand, the Onyx runs a heavily modified version of Android with a bunch of bespoke apps and stuff, so perhaps that's not such a bad thing.*

### Second Impressions

Once you get over the initial wow factor, there's a definite moment of "hang on a second... this looks a little suspicious". The Onyx includes an "App Store", but it's not the official Google Play store, and the first time you fire it up you get a rather unsettling message about how "all of the proposed apps in the App Store are collected from the Internet, for study reference only" - and when the first app on that list is *Amazon Kindle for Andorid9\10* [sic] the alarm bells start ringing just a little – mainly since most of the stuff I actually want to do with this tablet requires signing in to assorted cloud providers, and, well, I'm not 100% OK with typing my Google or Amazon credentials into a device that offers the *Kindle for Andorid9\10* app "for study reference only".

I did a little digging and [found some instructions on how to enable the Google Play store](https://blog.the-ebook-reader.com/2019/03/19/how-to-enable-google-play-app-on-onyx-boox-ereaders-video/). First, you need to enable the Google Play framework - there's an option for this in the device settings. I hit the button, a dialog popped up saying "Checking info...", and then nothing happened for fifteen minutes - but when I got bored of waiting and reset the device, when it booted back up, the Google Play store had appeared in the Apps menu. I opened it up and got another warning - "This device isn't Play Protect certified". Now, I'm guessing that's some kind of Google certification program that Onyx hasn't enrolled in; the workaround is to sign in to your Google account, and manually register the device ID as a trusted device.

The Onyx actually includes an interface for doing this - but to use it, you need to enter your Google credentials, and the form provided to do that is part of the Onyx UI: no address bar, no information about where they're going, and no way to view or verify any certificate information. I wasn't entirely happy with that, so rather than registered from the device, I opened up [https://www.google.com/android/uncertified/](https://www.google.com/android/uncertified/) on my desktop, typed in the GSF ID of the device, waited a few minutes for the cloud to catch up, and I was in business.

### Writing with Evernote and a Bluetooth keyboard

The main thing I want to do with the Onyx is writing; I've previously used my iPad with a Logitech K380 Bluetooth keyboard and Evernote to write all kinds of things, so I wanted to do a side-by-side comparison of the two. Here they are, literally side by side, outside in my garden in bright sunshine:

The iPad is running at full brightness there - and it's completely unusable; it's just too reflective. The Onyx, on the other hand, is just like paper: bright sunlight makes it *easier* to read.
