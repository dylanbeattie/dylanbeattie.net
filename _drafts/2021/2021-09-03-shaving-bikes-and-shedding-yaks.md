You work with humans for a little while, you'll probably encounter the delightful behaviour pattern known as "bike-shedding". Also known as Parkinson's Law of Triviality, it's the observation that organisations often spend a disproportionate amount of time discussing things that don't really matter, because those things are easy to understand, and neglecting the things that are important because those things are far more difficult and complex.

Parkinson provided the example of a committee approving the plans for a nuclear power plant: most of the committee don't actually know very much about nuclear reactors and power plant design, so they'll just nod and agree with whatever's on the table, but when it comes to deciding what colour to paint the shed where the plant staff will park their bicycles, suddenly everybody has an opinion.

I was once involved in developing a subscription management platform that was going to handle millions of pounds a year in revenue. When it came to details like how to handle leap years, the specific dates and times that payments should be taken, handling tax for overseas customers, most of the people involved were reluctant to make a decision, or even express an opinion, in case it turned out to be wrong. 

But the discussion about whether we should use a `border-radius` that should be used on the buttons in the user interface? That literally went on for three hours. That right there, that's some high-quality bike-shedding.

And then there's yak-shaving. I've seen this referred to as "meta-work"; it's all the stuff you've got to do before you can actually do the stuff you've got to do. Like, I want to write a blog post. First I'll make a cup of coffee… hang on, the coffee grinder isn't working, let me pop that open, oh, wait, I need to unscrew the grinder mechanism, which means I need to find a screwdriver, which is in the toolbox, which is in the shed… and the lock on the shed door is stuck. And so next thing you know I'm standing outside squirting WD40 into a rusty padlock and somebody says "hey, what are you doing?" and I'm like "…can't you see I'm writing a blog post?"

That's yak-shaving. Unlike bike-shedding, the name appears to be completely arbitrary; it comes from a 1991 episode of *The Ren and Stimpy Show* about "Yak Shaving Day".

So the obvious question is… if we have bike-shedding and yak-shaving, do the associated concepts of bike-shaving and yak-shedding exist?
