Once upon a time, the Friday pub lunch was a thing… around 1pm you'd glance at your inbox, decide most of it could wait until Monday if it absolutely had to, ping a few colleagues on Slack and head out to the pub for a nice relaxed lunch, maybe a pint or two. And at some point, eventually, somebody would look at their watch and say "we should probably head back to the office", and you'd all wander back and put in a few token hours of presenteeism until it was late enough to justifiably knock the week on the head and slope off back to the pub.

And now here we are, a good eighteen months since most people went out to lunch with their workmates, and that dreaded phrase "back to the office" is starting to crop up in all kinds of places. So what happens next?

Let's start with the obvious bit: what we've all just been through has not been "working from home." I know people who worked from home for *years* before the pandemic, and the events of the last eighteen months have been just as disruptive to them as they were to everybody else. But as vaccines roll out and restrictions begin to relax, companies and people everywhere are asking the same questions: what happens next, and when?

Now, personally, I'm not really affected by this. I haven't had an office job since 2019. I set up my own company in January 2020; COVID came along three months later, I tore up my business plan (and a lot of plane tickets) and started improvising a new one, and, well, things are doing OK. And a big part of that is down to my home office. I have a room in my house that's a dedicated office and recording studio. That's where I work. It is nicer, more comfortable and better-equipped than any corporate desk or office I have ever had in my life. When I get stuck coding or writing something, I can play guitar or piano for a few minutes while I think about it. I don't get interrupted. It's been nearly two years since somebody walked up to my desk and sort of hovered there until I stopped what I was doing, just so they could tell me that their email was being weird. 

But before this, I commuted into central London every day for fifteen years. Two hours a day, five days a week, say 45 weeks a year. That's six thousand, seven hundred and fifty hours of my life on packed commuter trains. I got a lot of colds. I got really good at iPhone Scrabble. I was late because of delays on the District Line. Most days I woke up miserable, not because I hated my life or anything, but because the first thing I had to do on any given working day was commute, and commuting is a degrading, unpleasant experience. Oh, and it's *expensive* – even before you add in the coffees and lunches and all the other stuff you just pay for in the course of a working day because, well, because that's just what you do.

I don't miss it. At all. And so many of my friends and former colleagues are in exactly the same position. People working in software, academia, publishing, engineering: for so many industries now, jobs are completely, entirely digital. Literally everything they do is code, or spreadsheets, or emails. Download, edit, review, upload, rinse, repeat. We run Slack and Teams, we have video meetings on Zoom and Meet and a dozen proprietary platforms nobody had ever heard of until last year… and we make it work.

Here's how I think the future might play out. 

A lot of companies seem to be compromising on some sort of "hybrid" model; employees must be in the office 1-2 days a week, and can work remote the rest of the time. And the thing about compromise is that you end up with a result that sort of sucks equally for everybody.

First, the (supposed) benefit of being in the office is that you can talk to people; that face-to-face conversation is a more efficient way to share information and context than Zoom calls or Slack. That only really works if all the people you need to talk to are also there, which means the office still needs to be big enough for everybody to be on site, safely, at the same time. There's no point going into the office on Mondays if only 20% of your colleagues can be there with you, because if you need to talk to any of the other 80%, you're right back on Zoom and Slack and wondering why you got up an hour earlier and travelled into work just to do Zoom calls from somewhere else.

So a company with, say, 100 employees decides that everybody needs to be in the office on Mondays. Call it 80% occupancy to allow for offsite meetings, holidays, etc. They need an office that'll safely accommodate 80 people. Rest of the week, there are 20, maybe 25 people on site. That's a *lot* of empty desks, and corporate real estate is… well, it ain't cheap.

For employees, hybrid is the worst of both worlds. You still need to live within commuting distance of the office, but you're also working from home 80% of the time. If you were 100%  remote, you could move somewhere further away, afford a bigger place, get a proper room at home to use an office. If you were 100% onsite, the fact you're working on your kitchen table and can't do Zoom calls while the washing machine is on wouldn't be a problem.

Of course, to a particular subset of the population, the very idea that offices won't be a thing any more is terrifying. A lot of very rich people have eyewatering sums of money tied up in commercial real estate – and before you start smiling too hard at the prospect of a bunch of millionaires seeing their fortunes wiped out, you might want to check how much of your pension is tied up in real estate investments.

No, I don't think hybrid is going to work; I think companies will gravitate towards one extreme or another. I believe the only truly sustainable models are fully onsite, or fully remote, because I fundamentally think those two working models aren't just about physical space; they're about how teams communicate, collaborate, solve problems, and that the majority of knowledge workers will naturally gravitate towards one or the other of those styles.

What remains to be seen is whether
