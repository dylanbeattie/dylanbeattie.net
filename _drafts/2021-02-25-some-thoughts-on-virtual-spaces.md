It’s nearly a year since I last attended a physical meetup; on March 12, 2020, I got the train up to Birmingham to speak at the Fusion meetup, came back to London afterwards, and… that was that; everything since then has been online, in one form or another. I’ve spoken at events on iChair, Vito, PINETool, Teams, Webex, Zoom, Slack, Discord, OBS.Ninja, YouTube, Twitch; I’ve run social meetups, taught workshops about how to run online workshops, taught online workshops about programming, communications, and even done some live magic show storytelling over Zoom for my niece’s birthday party. (*That* was a tough gig… you think keeping IT managers engaged over Zoom is hard, you should try toddlers…)

Some things work really, really well online - and, as an industry, we’re starting to figure out what those things are, and how to do them really, really well. But what that boils down to, really, is being prepared to take a step back, look at the kinds of interactions and outcomes that your events are trying to create, and then asking the question “ok, how do we do those things online?”

I was at an online meetup recently that had used the gather.town platform to replicate a physical meetup space - and they’d done a pretty nice job, too. It looked good. First impressions were “hey, this is cool!” But the illusion falls apart pretty quickly.

For starters, here’s the main stage area. In reality, yes, if you’re having 300 people at an event, you need 300 chairs. Which means you need a room big enough to accommodate 300 chairs. That’s a BIG room. Have you ever been in an empty conference centre? You don’t appreciate how big those spaces are until you walk across an empty one. But… in a virtual space, the avatars don’t need chairs. You know long it takes the little pixelated Dylan to waddle past all those rows of empty virtual seats?

And then there’s stages. I’ve seen several events that use a “virtual stage” as part of their setup. Again, it looks cool, reminds people of real event spaces. But I’ve also seen events where the virtual stage is just scenery – and that’s often not immediately apparent, because, hey, in Reality, an empty stage means nothing’s happening yet – right? So you take a virtual seat in the virtual hall, and you wait. And you wait. And nothing happens… and THEN you realise that to actually watch the talk, you’ve got to click a link, or open stream in a new window or something.

The thing about trying to replicate physical space is that the interaction patterns we use in physical space do not work online. One of the interesting features of **gather.town** is proximity - as your avatar approaches another person, their video feed sort of fades into view on your screen. But if they’re not looking at exactly the right window at exactly the right moment, they don’t know you’re there. I’m pretty sure some of them have forgotten they’re connected to a virtual event. The point about proximity, in reality, is that it doesn’t require your undivided attention to work – people just notice other people. We’re *really* good at that.

We’ve been having conversations online for decades. From unix `talk` to IRC to ICQ to Slack and Discord, we know how to talk to each other. Zoom, Webex, Skype, Teams… I’m not saying these are solved problems, but the thing that really, really matters is familiarity. We relax on Zoom calls because we’ve clocked up enough hours to know how it works. The video meeting system built into your online event platform… it doesn’t *matter* how good it is, it’s never going to achieve that level of familiarity.
