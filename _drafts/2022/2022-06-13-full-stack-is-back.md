The [FullStack eXchange](https://skillsmatter.com/conferences/13770-fullstack-exchange-2022) has long been one of my favourite conferences, and I'm really excited to be working with the new team at Skills Matter to bring it back for 2022. It'll be happening in person *and* online, 27-28 July 2022 – and as part of the FullStack fun, I'll be running my workshop Pure JavaScript Web Components, in person, here in London on the 25 & 26 July.

It's two days of hands-on,
