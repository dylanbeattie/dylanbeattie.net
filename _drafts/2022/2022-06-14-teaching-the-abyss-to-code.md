It's just before 1pm. I've just finished lunch: sandwiches, coffee, banana, a handful of giant Cadbury's buttons, out in the sunshine, because summer has finally arrived here in London and, well, what's the point in working at home if you can't eat lunch in your own garden?

I head back into my office/studio, sit down, check the camera and mic are on. At one-o-clock sharp, I unmute, switch the camera on, and give Zoom my biggest, most enthusiastic, I've-just-had-lunch-and-now-we're-gonna-learn-some-stuff smile... "hello, everybody! welcome back! I hope you all had a good lunch."

Then... I stop for a second. There are apparently thirty people connected to this call. Every single one of them has their mic on mute and their camera off. They've been like that all morning. Are they actually back from lunch? Is there anybody out there?  So I ask. "Hey folks, somebody give me a sign that you're actually out there, 'cos I honestly have no idea whether there is anybody else here or not..." 

A moment passes. A second, five seconds, ten... has the connection dropped? Am I just talking to a zombie Zoom that's somehow still on my screen even though there's nobody else here? And then a little yellow thumbs-up appears. Then another. Three, four, five... ok, there is apparently life on planet Zoom, even if it's trying to stay silent and invisible. I take a deep breath, drag Visual Studio onto my shared screen, and off we go.

We continue like this all afternoon, and throughout the following day. We're running interactive coding exercises -- attendees are running their own microservices and components, we're passing HTTP requests and I can see the network traffic. I know they're out there and participating, because I can see message queues showing up in the RabbitMQ dashboards.  A few attendees ask for help -- always via private message, in Zoom chat or Slack, where nobody else can see them. By the end of day 2, we have half-a-dozen different components running across various people's machines from London to Belgrade -- and we're running RabbitMQ server in an AWS data centre in Singapore, because, hey, if you're teaching distributed systems, you might as well *distribute* them, right?

At the end of the workshop, I send out a link to a feedback questionnaire, to find out how folks enjoyed it; what worked, what they liked and didn't like; any suggestions to improve it. Question 1: "What was your overall impression of the workshop?"

9 people answer "Wow! It was great!", 7 answer "yeah, it was pretty good.", 1 chooses "It was OK, I guess". Nobody chooses "I didn't like it."

That's over 90% going for "wow it was great" or "yeah it was pretty good". Not bad. That's only 17
