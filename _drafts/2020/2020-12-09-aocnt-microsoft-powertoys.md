Way back in the days of Windows 95, Microsoft released a set of freeware utilities called the [PowerToys for Windows 95](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_PowerToys#PowerToys_for_Windows_95). It included some things that were genuinely useful - like being able to right-click any folder and open a command prompt in that folder - and some stuff that was, um, less useful, like the FindX tool that added a drag'n'drop capability nobody wanted to a Find menu nobody ever used...

Fast-forward a few decades, and [the PowerToys are back](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys) - this time for Windows 10. They're free-as-in-beer, they're free-as-in-speech (MIT license), and they're really rather good. There's two that particularly stand out for me. One is the [Windows key shortcut guide](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/wiki/Shortcut-Guide-Overview) - hold down the Windows key for more than a second and an onscreen guide pops up telling you all the available shortcuts:![image-20201206195822478](/images/posts/2020-12-advent/image-20201206195822478.png)

The other is the  [Image Resizer](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/wiki/Image-Resizer-Overview), a shell extension that offers bulk image resizing via a right-click context menu, which is incredibly useful when you've got a bunch of 20 megapixel images off your DSLR camera and you want to email copies to somebody without breaking the internet.

Alongside those, there are a bunch of tools for video conferencing, batch renaming files, and organising your Windows desktop â€“ I've heard that [Fancy Zones](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/wiki/FancyZones-Overview) is fantastic if you've got one of those [ultra-super-mega-widescreen wraparound displays](https://www.samsung.com/uk/monitors/gaming/qled-gaming-monitor-with-329-super-ultra-wide-screen-49-inch-lc49hg90dmuxen/). They're definitely worth a look if you're a Windows power user, and the PowerToys team is adding new experimental tools and utilities all the time so check back often to see what's new.

Check them out at [https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys), or go straight to the  [releases page](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/releases/) for the latest installer.
