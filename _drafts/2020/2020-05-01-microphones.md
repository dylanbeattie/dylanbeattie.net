A conference is about **speakers** giving **talks**. Not looks, not stands, not dances – **talks**. We are speakers, we are there to talk, and our audiences are there to listen. If your audience can't hear you, you've lost them, no matter how beautiful your slides or or how many hours you've spent practising – and when you're presenting online, your microphone is the [Jesus nut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus_nut) – the single point of failure that can bring the whole thing crashing down.

You can easily spend a [fortune](https://www.thomann.de/gb/large_diaphragm_mics.html?oa=prd) on specialist microphones, but if you don't know what you're doing, it won't make any difference – and if you *do* know what you're doing, you can get great results from relatively inexpensive kit.

You want the mic as close to your mouth as you can get it – between 2" (5cm) and 6" (30cm)  is ideal – and as far away from any other source of noise as you can. The mic that's built in to your laptop is not going to cut it. It's at long way from your face, it's right next to your keyboard – which means every keystroke sounds like a tap-dancing elephant to all your listeners – and being built in to your laptop means it's probably on a nice big desk or table that'll pick up noise and vibration from every footstep and passing car. 

So the built-in mic in your expensive laptop is a no-no – sorry! – but like I said, that doesn't mean you need to buy expensive equipment. Even just the earphones that came with your phone are a thousand times better – plug them in, make sure the cord microphone isn't catching on your collar or rubbing on your jacket. If you have an external webcam, many of them have a reasonable microphone built in that works OK if you stay relatively close, don't move around too much, and keep looking straight at it. I've also had good results using a gaming headset with a built-in microphone, and with a set of Bluetooth earphones I bought for the gym. 

The golden rule with any microphone, though is: **listen to yourself.** Install some audio recording software – [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/) is free, open-source and cross-platform – and make sure to listen through headphones. Record 30 seconds of silence and listen back to it. What do you hear? Traffic noise? Dishwasher? Mouse clicks? If you can hear it, your audience will hear it. You might not able to eliminate background noise entirely, but figure out what you can to reduce it – close windows, close doors, take off your shoes, switch off the aircon. Make yourself a pre-flight checklist.

Now record 30 seconds of you speaking. at the same volume you'd use when giving a talk, and listen back to that. Try reading these ten sentences out loud, then listen back and see what you sound like:

1. The dark pot hung in the front closet.
2. Carry the pail to the wall and spill it there.
3. The train brought our hero to the big town.
4. We are sure that one war is enough.
5. Grey paint stretched for miles around.
6. The rude laugh filled the empty room.
7. High seats are best for football fans.
8. Tea served from the brown jug is tasty.
9. A dash of pepper spoils beef stew.
10. A zestful food is the hot-cross bun.

This is one of 72 lists of stock phrases known as the "[Harvard Sentences](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~hgs/audio/harvard.html)":

> "a collection of phonetically balanced sentences that measure a large range of different qualities in the human voice. These were originally published in 1969 as the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers recommended practice for speech quality measurements."

 – you can find the whole list online at http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~hgs/audio/harvard.html

If you hear loud pop or thud on words like 'pepper' and 'beef', that's called a *plosive* – it's the mic picking up the sharp release of breath that happens when we pronounce letters like 'b' and 'p'. See if you can move the mic downwards or to the side slightly so that it isn't directly in front of your mouth. If you hear hissing or whistling on words like 'stew' and 'seats', that's called *sibilance* – try moving the mic a little further away from your mouth.

Play with the distance until you've got a good clear voice with minimal background noise, but you're not getting any hissing or popping. If your mic has a volume control, turn it up until you're about as loud as you can go without hearing any distortion or seeing any warning lights, then back it off about 5%. Do this every time you change anything – move the furniture, get a new mic, install new drivers. And remember the golden rule: **listen to yourself.** That's what your audience is going to be listening to for an hour – if it doesn't sound good in your own room, on your own headphones, there's no *wa*y that sending it halfway around the world on a video call is going to make it any better.
