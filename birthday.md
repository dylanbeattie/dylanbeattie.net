# Dylan's Birthday Guitaraoke 2022!

---

<dl>
    <dt>What's guitaraoke?</dt>
    <dd>It's like karaoke - but with live guitars!</dd>
    <dt>But I can't play the guitar (or bass!)</dt>
    <dd>No problem! Come along and sing like it's a regular karaoke night. Or, y'know, just come along
    and drink beer and have fun. That's fine too. ðŸ˜ƒ</dd>
    <dt>Do I have to sign up in advance?</dt>
    <dd>No. But if there's a song you REALLY REALLY want to play
      or sing, let me know and I'll try to make it happen.
    </dd>
    <dt>Do I need to bring anything?</dt>
    <dd>Just your favourite plectrum. I'll provide guitars, bass, backline, mics... all the things. (See the <a href="#gear-list">gear list</a> if you need to know what'll be there!</dd>
    <dt>I can just turn up and play? I don't need to lug my guitar along?</dt>
    <dd>Yes.</dd>
    <dt>Can I bring my guitar anyway?</dt>
    <dd>Sure. But it's at your own risk, and you might only get to play one or two songs.</dd>
    <dt>Can I bring my pedalboard?</dt>
    <dd>Yeah, but we won't have any time to soundcheck, so be prepared to plug in and play.</dd>
    <dt>Can I bring my amp?</dt>
    <dd>No. We'll run everything through the PA.</dd>
    <dt>Can I bring my harmonica/saxophone/trumpet/mandolin?</dt>
    <dd>Sure! We won't have backing tracks, but if you wanna jam along with whatever else is playing,
      go for it (and I'll make sure there's a couple of extra microphones if you need one.)
    </dd>
    <dt>What key is everything in?</dt>
    <dd>Most tracks are the same as the original recording</dd>
    <dd><em>NOTE: Some bands (e.g. Guns 'n' Roses) tune everything down half a step in the studio. <strong>We don't</strong>. All the instruments
    are tuned to concert pitch, so when we play Sweet Child O' Mine, we play the same chords/shapes as G'n'R, but their version
    comes out in Db and our version comes out in D.</em></dd>
