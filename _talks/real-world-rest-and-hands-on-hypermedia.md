title: Real-world ReST and Hands-on Hypermedia
description: |
  So you've built your HTTP API, and now that it's live, you're suddenly dealing with a whole new set of problems. Do you really need to PUT the entire customer object just to change someone's email address? Why does it take you 25 API calls just to render a shopping cart? How do you find the bottlenecks when just drawing a web page requires 50 HTTP requests? What happens when one of your API consumers accidentally tries to GET your entire customer database?

  In this talk, we'll look at the problems of running ReSTful APIs in the real world, and the architectural patterns that exist to help us solve those problems. We'll talk about hypermedia - how it works and why it matters. We'll look at resource expansion, and how it can reduce your server workload and speed up your client applications. We'll talk about how to implement PATCH properly, how to handle security and authentication for your APIs, and what tools and services exist to help you design, deliver and debug your HTTP APIs.
