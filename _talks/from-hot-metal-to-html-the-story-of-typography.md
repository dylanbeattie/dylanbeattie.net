title: "From Hot Metal to HTML: The Story of Typography"
description: |
  Arial, Times New Roman, Consolas, Comic Sans... digital typography has turned us all into typesetters. The tools we use, the apps we build, the emails we send: with so much of our lives mediated by technology, something as seemingly innocuous as picking a typeface can end up defining our relationship with the systems we use, and become part of the identity that we project into the world. Typography is a fundamental part of modern information design, with implications for user experience, accessibility, even performance - and when it goes wrong, it can produce some of the most baffling bugs you've ever seen.
    
  Join Dylan Beattie for a journey into the weird and wonderful history of digital typography, from the origins of movable type in 8th century Asia, to the world of e-ink displays and web typography. We'll look at the relationship between technology and typography over the centuries: the Gutenberg Press, Linotype machines, WYSIWYG and the desktop publishing revolution. What was so special about the Apple II?  How do you design a pixel font? We'll learn why they're called upper and lower case, we'll talk about why so many developers find CSS counter-intuitive - and we'll find out why so many emails used to end with the letter J.
