title: "Architecture: The Stuff That's Hard to Change"
description: |
  We’ve all heard of the idea of ‘software architecture’. We’ve read books about domain-driven design and event sourcing, we’ve been to conferences and learned about micro services and REST APIs. Some of us remember working with n-tiers and stored procedures; some of us are still using them. But the role of a systems architect is still one of the most misunderstood things about the software development process. What does an architect actually do? If you’re working with a systems architect, what can you expect from them? And if you are a systems architect, what is your team expecting from you?

  In this talk, Dylan Beattie will share his own insights into the idea of architecture as part of a software development process. We’ll explore some popular architectural patterns and processes – and a couple of obscure ones as well – and look at how, and when, you can incorporate those patterns into your own projects. We’ll talk about how the idea of software architecture has changed over time, and share some tips and advice for developers who find themselves working with architecture as part of their role.
