title: "The Tech Behind the Linebreakers"
description: |
  The Linebreakers are the world's nerdiest party band, with a live show that's a mixture of music, video, comedy, guitar riffs, and bad jokes about JavaScript.

  It goes without saying that everybody in the band loves to geek out about software and technology... and behind the scenes of every Linebreakers show there's a whole bunch of weird custom software and hardware, from video encoding pipelines, to PowerPoint macros, to modified guitar pedals with Arduino controllers inside them. Come along and find out what we did, why we did it - and how running a live rock show brings a whole new meaning to the idea of "testing in production".
