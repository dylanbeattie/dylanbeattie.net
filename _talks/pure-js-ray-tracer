    We live in a networked world. Between our laptops, our phones, and the smart gadgets 
    in our kitchen, many of us are online 24/7. We work and play, communicate and 
    collaborate, across digital networks powered by open protocols - the standards 
    and specifications that form the backbone of the modern internet.

    But within the last decade, we've seen many online interactions move away from 
    open protocols and onto closed platforms. We've abandoned SMS for Signal and 
    WhatsApp, we've abandoned email in favour of Slack, Teams, and Discord; 
    restaurants use Instagram and Facebook instead of running their own websites. 
    And, most of the time, it works â€“ but as more and more of our digital experiences 
    are mediated by corporations and the platforms they control, what does this mean 
    for the future of the internet? Amidst all the hype about "web 3" and the
     "metaverse", let's take a moment to remind ourselves how we got here, and 
     remember what's at stake. We'll look back at the promise of "web 2.0" and 
     what it actually delivered, we'll talk about digital identity and net 
     neutrality - and we'll learn what the Apollo/Soyuz space missions have 
     to do with the digital protocols that underlie our connected society.
