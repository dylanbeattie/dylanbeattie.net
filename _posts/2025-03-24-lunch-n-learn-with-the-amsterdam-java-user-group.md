I'm in the Netherlands. Last week was running some presentation training with a group at Info Support in Veenendaal, the weekend was catching up with friends in Amsterdam, and tomorrow I'm speaking at a student conference in Utrecht. One of the things about travelling for a living is that there's no such thing as "out of office", and the Todo List doesn't stop just 'cos you're away for a week or two. My schedule said that today I'd be preparing examples and demos for [a Zoom masterclass](https://techcornwall.co.uk/training/modern-fundamentals-of-web-application-development-masterclass/) I'm giving on Thursday with the folks from Tech Cornwall.

So when I got an email from [Geertjan Wielenga](https://www.linkedin.com/in/geertjanwielenga/), who runs the [Amsterdam Java User Group](https://www.meetup.com/amsterdam-java-user-group/), asking if I wanted to do a lunch'n'learn session, I naturally said "no" - mainly 'cos I'd already have left Amsterdam for Utrecht. But, as Geerjan pointed out, the two cities are ridiculously close together... so I decided, what the hell. Usually, when I do in-person events, I bring something that's prepared and polished: talk, slides,  video... you know. What some folks call a "Dylan Talk". Today, we did the complete opposite: all I brought with me was a list of topics I'm still working on, and after sandwiches and coffee in Geertjan's kitchen, we spent a fun hour putting together demos, learning  about the weird and wonderful edge cases of modern web standards (did you know `border-radius` can have EIGHT different values? ðŸ¤¯)

Here's a few links to the stuff we looked at:

* [Organic blobs in CSS with border-radius at bram.us](https://www.bram.us/2021/12/26/organic-blobs-in-css-with-border-radius/)

* [The HTML `<dialog>` element at MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/dialog)

* [The story of #rebeccapurple](https://medium.com/@valgaze/the-hidden-purple-memorial-in-your-web-browser-7d84813bb416)

and the code from the session is all up on GitHub:

Fun session. And a nice reminder that not every tech event needs to be rehearsed and polished - sometimes all you need is people, coffee and curiosity.
