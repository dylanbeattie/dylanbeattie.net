Nothing to do with DBML tools. Just looks pretty." src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_LV_l8kYLOwo/SQ3lR1lzDLI/AAAAAAAAAGU/s8WPjlK-8hE/IMG_0746_thumb%5B6%5D.jpg?imgmax=800" width="260" align="left" border="0" /></a></p>  <p> I haven't had a chance to use them yet, but the <a href="http://www.huagati.com/dbmltools/">Huagati DBML/EDMX tools</a> look interesting - a set of extensions to the DBML designer in Visual Studio 2008 that provide some additional functionality, including the much-needed ability to update your DBML to reflect changes in your database schema. It's a commercial package costing $119.95 per user, but a free trial license is available.</p>  <p>With Microsoft effectively abandoning Linq-to-SQL, it's good to see tools like this in the wild. Of course, it'd be <strong>really</strong> good to see Microsoft open-source Linq-to-SQL and let the community develop it as they see fit... but failing that, these tools can make things easier if you're maintaining an existing Linq-to-SQL system.</p>
