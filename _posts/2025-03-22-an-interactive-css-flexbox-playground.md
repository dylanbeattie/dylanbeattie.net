CSS flexbox is fantastic... but it's also incredibly complicated. A flex container has half-a-dozen different CSS rules which control how content will flex and flow within the container, and figuring out the exact combination that you'll need to implement a particular design can be a lengthy and error-prone process.

So I built a thing to make it a little easier to see what's going on: an interactive CSS flexbox playground. Based on - and with visuals inspired by - Chris Coyler's excellent [CSS Flexbox Layout Guide](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) over at css-tricks.com, it'll let you pick different values for all the various CSS flex properties and see how they affect your layout.

Happy flexing :)
