2020 was the year that webcams suddenly became a big deal. For folks who'd already been working remote for a while, it was no surprise how important camera and audio quality are for video meetings - Scott Hanselman wrote a [great post about this](https://www.hanselman.com/blog/good-better-best-creating-the-ultimate-remote-worker-webcam-setup-on-a-budget) back in August last year - but with the entire world suddenly working from home, webcams sold out pretty much everywhere back in March and lots of folks have been working remote using their laptop's built-in camera.

Of course, most of those folks also have a smartphone, and the camera in most modern smartphones is truly astonishing, which raises the question: can I use the camera in my phone as a webcam? There are several apps out there that claim to do this, and I'm pretty sure I've tried all of them, but the first one that's actually worked for me is [Camo](https://reincubate.com/camo/) by Reincubate. 

I've tried it with an iPhone 6S and an iPhone SE, on a 2014 Macbook Pro and a couple of different Windows machines, and been really, really impressed. It just works. Run the installer, install the app, connect your phone using a USB cable, and it works. The image quality is fantastic; the free version gives you control over the camera's focus and resolution, and if you pay Â£34.99 for the Pro version, you get full control over your phone camera's exposure, white balance and various other settings.

Plus - did I mention the image quality is good? Here is in Zoom, side-by-side with my Logitech C920 HD webcam:

It's on macOS and Windows, but it's iPhone only (sorry, Android fans.) The consumer version of Camo for Windows is still in beta - there's a signup form on their site; I've been running it on Windows for a month or so without any problems at all, including running it alongside four other cameras in a really elaborate multi-cam streaming setup. 

Oh, and apparently there's a 40% off until December 4th if you sign up with the code **CYBERCAMO**.
