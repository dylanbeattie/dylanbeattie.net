title: Fifteen Electronic Devices... Is That A LOT?

Every airline's cabin baggage regulations are subtly different. 10kg plus a personal item. 10kg INCLUDING a personal item. 8kg plus a personal item. 8kg, plus a personal item of up to 2kg. 8kg plus a laptop, umbrella, walking cane OR a personal item up to 2kg. 23kg as long as it'll fit in the overhead locker _(go British Airways!)&#32;_

For a long while LOT, Poland's national airline, would let you travel with "up to five dogs, cats, or ferrets, unless they are for commercial purposes", which is wonderful because the collective noun for ferrets in English is "business", as in "a business of ferrets", so technically on LOT you could take a business of ferrets with you, but not a business ferret. Alas, this particular wording has disappeared in a recent update to their website, but I did notice a new regulation that passengers are allowed a maximum of fifteen personal electronic devices (PEDs), defined as anything containing a lithium-ion battery. You know, the ones that are in literally every single device which exists these days but which very occasionally go on fire so airlines are understandably a bit flummoxed about exactly what to do about them.

It's not readily apparent [from their website](https://www.lot.com/gb/en/journey/baggage/hazardous-materials#expansion-panel-13-content) whether that's fifteen PEDs per passenger _total_, or just in checked baggage (and I didn't think you could put li-ion batteries in the hold at all, but apparently that's just for actual spare batteries and powerbanks now, and doesn't apply to devices containing a battery)... but fifteen's a lot, right? 

Well... actually, no.  Not if you're a massive nerd. Here's my inventory for Build Stuff in Vilnius:

1. MacBook Pro laptop
2. Framework Windows laptop
3. iPhone
4. backup iPhone
5. Smartwatch
6. Powerbank
7. Samsung Galaxy tablet
8. XVive in-ear monitoring receiver
9. XVive in-ear monitoring transmitter
10. Wireless guitar transmitter
11. Wireless guitar receiver
12. Anker SoundCore noise-cancelling headphones
13. Sony C100 wireless earbuds
14. JBL portable Bluetooth speaker

That's the standard inventory for any event where I'm doing a technical presentation and playing a show with Linebreakers - fourteen devices! Nice to know I could add a Kindle to that lot and still be within the regulations. 

I note with some amusement that if I replaced the Sony earbuds with Airpods Pro or similar, that would technically be \*three\* PEDs, since each earbud has its own battery and there is a third battery in the charging case. So better not do that, then.
