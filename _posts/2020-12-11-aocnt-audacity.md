Audacity is a free program for recording and editing audio files - sound recordings, samples, music. More than an audio player, but simpler than a full-blown digital audio workstation like ProTools or Logic Pro, it's another one of those tools that I find myself reaching for way more often than you might think.

If you've ever wanted to edit a sound clip to include it in a presentation, record a voiceover, or even just record your own microphone to see what you sound like before that Zoom job interview you've got coming up, Audacity is ideal. It'll read and write just about any audio format you can think of. It also includes dozens of professional-quality effects, filters and tone generators - so if you want to know what you'd sound like as a Dalek, Audacity can help.
