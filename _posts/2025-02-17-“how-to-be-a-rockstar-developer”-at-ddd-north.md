I'm off to Hull this weekend for [DDD North](https://dddnorth.co.uk/) where I'll be presenting [**How To Be A Rockstar Developer**](https://dylanbeattie.net/talks/how-to-be-a-rockstar-developer.html) - the story of how a programming language I invented in a bar as a joke got way out of hand, and ended up as a real thing, complete with a web assembly runtime, test suite, documentation... and lots of stupid jokes about Bon Jovi.

I love DDD (which is short for Developer! Developer! Developer!, inspired by a thing Steve Ballmer did when he was CEO of Microsoft, and not to be confused with Domain-Driven Design which is a completely different thing). It's a series of free, one-day developer events around the UK. And in Australia, but that's a bit far to go for a one-day event. And apparently they had one in Seoul. DDD's historical associations with Microsoft mean it attracts a lot of folks who work with .NET, but with an open CFP and sessions chosen via a public vote, there's usually a pretty good balance of speakers and topics.

It's free, it's on a Saturday - this Saturday, in fact! - and it's always a really friendly bunch of people. There's still a few tickets left at [dddnorth.co.uk](http://dddnorth.co.uk/), and if you're going to be around, come and say hi.
