Uncompressed digital audio is stored in the same format as old-fashioned audio CDs – 74 mins of raw audio takes up 740Mb or thereabouts. This means that a good afternoon’s recording can easily create 2-3Gb of files – and they’re not like MP3s or movies that are easy enough to replace; these are often the only copy in the world of that one killer solo or that bass riff that I’ve been practising for weeks and just happened to <em>nail</em> it this afternoon. </p>  <p>Stuff like Carbonite or Mozy is all well and good for documents and holiday snaps, but given I have consumer ADSL (512Kb upstream), is there even any point thinking about offsite backup for my audio projects, or am I better off just copying stuff to a USB hard drive and maybe taking a drive into work every couple of months? What do people do with video / post-processing stuff? What’s your backup strategy when the actual work you’re doing is creating gigabytes of files on a daily basis? </p>  <p><small>[photo from <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/spadgy/313252221/">john_a_ward via flickr</a> – thanks for sharing, John.]</small></p>
