<p>A quick but very simple technique to limit the number of instances of a .NET app that will execute at once:</p>  <blockquote>   <pre>using System;
using System.Linq;
using System.Diagnostics;

namespace ConsoleApplication1 {
  public class Program {
    static void Main(string[] args) {

      var MAX_PERMITTED_INSTANCES = 3;

      var myProcessName = Process.GetCurrentProcess().ProcessName;
      Process[] processes = Process.GetProcesses();
      var howManyOfMe = processes.Where(p =&gt; p.ProcessName == myProcessName).Count();
      if (howManyOfMe &gt; MAX_PERMITTED_INSTANCES) {
        Console.WriteLine(&quot;Too many instances - exiting!&quot;);
      } else {
        Console.WriteLine(&quot;I'm process #{0} and I'm good to go!&quot;, howManyOfMe);
        /* do heavy lifting here! */
      }
      Console.ReadKey(false);
    }
  }
}</pre>

<p>Very handy if – like we do – you’re firing off potentially expensive encoding jobs every few minutes via a scheduled task, and you’re happy for 3-4 of them to be running at any one time – hey, that’s what multicore CPUs are for, right? - but you’d rather not end up with 37 instances of encoder.exe all fighting for your CPU cycles like cats fighting for the last bit of bacon.</p>

<p>I’m still sometimes really, really impressed at how easy stuff like this is in .NET… I thought this would end up being hours of horrible extern/Win32 API calls, but no. It’s that easy. Very nice.</p>
