It&#8217;s one of my favourite movies, and it&#8217;s also astonishing how a movie that I loved when I was seven years old has retained it&#8217;s appeal for over twenty years - it&#8217;s like it somehow evolved from a time-travel movie into a 50s/80s <em>period</em> time-travel movie without ever really looking dated in between. (That, or I&#8217;m just a huge nerd with an 80s obsession who never really grew up.)</p>  <p>Anyway, you know the scene where Marty&#8217;s playing at his parents&#8217; high-school dance, and he&#8217;s about to leave, and the band ask if he&#8217;ll play one more &#8211; &#8220;c&#8217;mon, something that really <em>cooks</em>&#8221; &#8211; and Marty steps up to the mic, jokes about &#8220;this one&#8217;s an oldie&#8230; at least, it&#8217;s an oldie where I come from&#8221; &#8211; and then he plays a storming version of Johnny B. Goode, and invents rock&#8217;n&#8217;roll? Well, as a kid watching this movie over and over, that&#8217;s one of the things that never, ever made any sense to me. Time travel, fine &#8211; I mean, they have a nuclear DeLorean, right? &#8211; but the band jamming along, in perfect time, to a song they&#8217;d never, ever heard before? <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093779/quotes">Inconceivable</a>!</p>  <p>A couple of years later I took up the guitar, probably inspired in no small part by Marty McFly, and along the way I started picking up odd bits of music theory. I remember watching&#160; Back to the Future one day around this time, and noticing something I&#8217;d never noticed before&#8230; just before Marty starts his whole Johnny B. Goode riff, he says to the band &#8220;Ok, guys, this is a blues riff in B; watch me for the changes, and try to keep up, OK?&#8221; Right up until that point, I&#8217;d been teaching myself guitar, on my own, by playing along to tapes and stuff. I&#8217;d never been in a band and never really taken any formal music classes. I had some music theory books, and I knew vaguely what a &quot;blues riff&quot; was, but I&#8217;d never stopped to think why that <em>particular</em> chord sequence had a special name. See, when you&#8217;re playing guitar by yourself in your bedroom, you <strong>don&#8217;t need to communicate</strong> with other musicians, so a lot of things &#8211; sheet music, sight reading, key changes and music theory &#8211; just seem like a complete waste of time. Of course, to seasoned pros like the musicians in Marvin Berry&#8217;s Starlighters, those two simple bits of information - &#8220;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelve_bar_blues">blues riff</a>&#8221; and &#8220;in B&#8221; &#8211; tell them <em>exactly</em> what&#8217;s about to happen &#8211; at least, in enough detail that they can join in at the right point, hit the right notes, and work the rest out as they go along.</p>  <p>What&#8217;s this got to do with software? Well, <em>blues riff<strong> </strong></em>refers to a 12-bar blues chord progression, which is a <em>pattern - </em>in both senses of the word. Trivially, it&#8217;s a repeating sequence of things; in this case musical chords. It&#8217;s also a pattern in the software/architecture sense - a recurring &#8216;solution&#8217; that&#8217;s implemented in many different contexts. Whilst the implementation details may vary wildly from one implementation to the next, the underlying structure doesn&#8217;t. Whether it&#8217;s jazz, thrash, funk or fusion, you&#8217;ll find twelve-bar patterns cropping up all over the place in contemporary music, and </p>  <p>This is why design patterns are important in software development. Knowing them doesn&#8217;t necessarily make you a better programmer. Just as someone can play a wonderful tune without knowing what all the notes are called, it&#8217;s quite possible to implement design patterns without being aware that&#8217;s what you&#8217;re doing. I built some code years ago that used an &#8216;active record&#8217; design.&#160; At the time, I had never worked with design patterns. I had no idea that my &#8220;objects-based-on-tables&#8221; solution had a name, or that anyone else was doing the same thing. Without that shared vocabulary, though, collaborating on that code was <em>painful</em>. I had to explain that code line-by-line, explain what it does, how it works, how all the pieces fit together. It&#8217;s time-consuming, it&#8217;s error-prone, and it&#8217;s probably really, really boring for the person listening to the explanation.</p>  <p>Imagine Marty McFly turning to the band and saying &#8220;OK, guys, this song has this chord here (<em>plays a B chord)</em> for four bars, then two bars of a this one (<em>plays an A chord) &#8211; </em>got that? &#8211; and then two bars of that first chord again&#8230;&#8221; and so on for about ten minutes; and the band are working it out and making notes as he goes along, so they can remember what goes where, and by the time he&#8217;s done, the crowd&#8217;s got bored and lost interest, Lorraine&#8217;s gone home with Biff, and George is out in the parking lot crying quietly into a copy of <em>Amazing Stories</em>. </p>  <p>On the other hand, you can learn the patterns. Not because they&#8217;ll make you a better coder, but because they&#8217;ll transform your ability to communicate with other pattern-literate developers. You&#8217;ll learn them, and you&#8217;ll practice them at home, on your own little projects, and then when Lead Architect Martin McFowler turns round at the start of your next project and says &#8220;OK, this is a <a href="http://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/domainModel.html">domain model</a> with data access via a <a href="http://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/repository.html">repository</a>, we&#8217;ll manage references via an <a href="http://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/identityMap.html">identity map</a> and use <a href="http://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/concreteTableInheritance.html">concrete table inheritance</a> to map the subclasses&#8221;, you can sit down, work out how to apply those patterns to your particular project, and <em><strong>bam!</strong></em> &#8211; you&#8217;ve just invented rock&#8217;n&#8217;roll.</p>  <p><img style="display: block; float: none; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" alt="http://www.seeing-stars.com/Locations/BTTF/Dance-JohnnyBGoode(smaller).JPG" src="http://www.seeing-stars.com/Locations/BTTF/Dance-JohnnyBGoode%28smaller%29.JPG" /></p>
