<ol>   <li>When the phone's first switched on, it's locked. When the phone is locked, it display's the owner's name and number and - here's the twist - it can <strong>call certain predefined numbers.</strong> So if I drop it in the street and you pick it up, you can use it to call my house and tell me you've found it - but you can't use it for anything else.</li>    <li>I want to be able to call my own phone (e.g. from a landline), enter a PIN, and switch it to Loud Ringing remotely - so next time I lose it somewhere around my house whilst it's on <strong>silent</strong>, I can reactivate the ringer from another phone.</li> </ol>  <p>Both are basic software features you can probably implement in any modern handset - they don't use any new hardware or infrastructure. I guess since they make it easier to find missing phones, they make it less likely you'll end up buying another one, though...</p>
