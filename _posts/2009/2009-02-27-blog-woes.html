<p>Windows Live Writer on Windows 7 is a little… unstable. &quot;The “Save” button crashes it. So I was playing around with a couple of other blog clients today… two non-starters and one that helpfully ignored the “post as draft” button. So ignore the post about nulls being null, ‘cos it’s not finished, and bear with me until I get this thing sorted. (Other than the Live Writer problems, Windows 7 is really looking quite nice. Like Vista but quicker and less… opinionated. I like it.)</p>
