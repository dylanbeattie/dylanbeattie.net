<p><a href="http://www.red-gate.com/">Red Gate</a> make really great software – if you work with SQL Server or .NET and haven’t checked out Red Gate’s offerings, I highly recommend them.&#160; They also sponsor the UK Alt.Net conferences, they’re frequently voted one of the top ten workplaces in the UK – and I just stumbled across this, on the 11th page of their (legally binding) <a href="http://www.red-gate.com/purchase/license.pdf">license agreements</a>:</p>  <blockquote>   <p align="center"><strong>SCHEDULE 3       <br />BEERWARE        <br /></strong>The following Beerware is licensed on a free basis:*</p>    <p>DTS Package Compare     <br />SQL Log Rescue</p>    <p>* subject to a non-binding obligation on the Licensee (or their representative) to buy a beer for     <br />a representative of the Licensor at any trade conference at which the Licensee (or their      <br />representative) and the Licensor's representative are both present, provided, however, that      <br />the Licensee (or their representative) should not attempt to purchase a beer where to do so      <br />would be unlawful in the relevant jurisdiction.</p> </blockquote>  <p>Even their <em>lawyers</em> are awesome. I love Red Gate.</p>
