<p>In Microsoft SQL Server, this query won’t work:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>SELECT * FROM ( SELECT * FROM Customer UNION SELECT * FROM Supplier) ORDER BY CompanyName</p> </blockquote>  <p>But – if you ask <em>nicely</em>, it does exactly what you’d expect:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>SELECT * FROM ( SELECT * FROM Customer UNION SELECT * FROM Supplier) <strong><font color="#ff0000">PLEASE</font> </strong>ORDER BY CompanyName</p> </blockquote>  <p>You won’t believe the look on your colleague’s faces when you solve their problem using simple good manners.</p>  <p><small>(Of course, it actually works because PLEASE in that context just acts as a table-name alias for result of the UNION sub-select, and sub-selects in SQL Server need to have a name. But don't let that stop you using it for fun and profit.)</small>
