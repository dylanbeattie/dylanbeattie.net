I ran inside to grab a camera, hoping he'd still be there when I got back - and he was. He stayed around for most of the afternoon, perching on the tree, the washing line, the shovel, chasing spiders around - at one point he was sitting literally two feet away from me, and actually started singing.  It was absolutely mesmerising.<br /><br />The photo is complete luck; he was hopping around so much I didn't have time to frame or set up a shot, so I just snapped him whenever he stopped for a moment. I was thrilled that this one came out so well.<br clear="all" />
