<p>This one stumped me until I hit upon the magical combination that makes it work.</p>  <ol>   <li>Install Windows 7 Service Pack 1.</li>    <li>Download the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?displaylang=en&amp;id=7887">Remote Server Administration Tools for WindowsÂ® 7 with SP1</a></li>    <li>Install them.</li>    <li>Reboot</li>    <li>Go into Start -&gt; Control Panel -&gt; Programs and Features, and go to &quot;Turn Windows features on or off&quot; - because the installer will download and install the admin tools, but won't actually switch them on. Helpful.</li> </ol> <a href="http://lh5.ggpht.com/-fOHA9UiZnGI/TfN35TdM4-I/AAAAAAAAAGY/_WMm5eSE-Yc/s1600-h/image%25255B4%25255D.png"><img style="display: block; float: none; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" title="image" alt="image" src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/-jLGdJvPd3HM/TfN35-OveaI/AAAAAAAAAGc/b3SDApHZXe4/image_thumb%25255B2%25255D.png?imgmax=800" width="811" height="362" /></a>  <p>What makes it fun is that it just fails silently until you get it right. No error messages, no warnings... installer didn't even tell me I was missing SP1 - which I thought I already had.</p>
