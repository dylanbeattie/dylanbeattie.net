A <a href="http://skillsmatter.com/podcast/ajax-ria/javascript-dotnet">full video of the talk</a> is also available on the SkillsMatter website – and you’ll be pleased to hear that their awesome new video processing rig means you can now see my grinning face AND read the code samples on the slides.</p>  <p>The NodeJS demo code is open source and is online at <a href="https://github.com/dylanbeattie/BomberJS">https://github.com/dylanbeattie/BomberJS</a> – fork it, pull it, do whatever you like with it. No warranties as to whether it’s any good or not… but it’s there and it works.</p>  <p>A couple of people asked afterwards about running Node on Windows, as I was doing in the demos. I was using a compiled binary from <a href="http://node-js.prcn.co.cc/">http://node-js.prcn.co.cc/</a>, which worked absolutely fine for little demo apps with 5-6 concurrent client connections. I've no idea how it scales, but the general consensus seems to be that you should stick to Linux / MacOS for hosting any significant Node applications.</p>
