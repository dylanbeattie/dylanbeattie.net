I floated the idea on Twitter and got a pretty enthusiastic response, and so I set up the first LonDev hack day. 12 people, in a room, for one day, working together to build and ship a working game.</p>  <p>Did we do it? You'll have to read all about it on the <a href="http://www.londev.org/">new LonDev wiki</a>, but personally, I'm really pleased at how it went, and really&#160; excited at the idea of organising the next one.</p>  <p>What's really encouraging is the mix of people and expertise who contributed. We had a couple of .NET coders, some Ruby/Rails guys, some JS web hackers who'd not done node/socket stuff before, and <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/palfrey">@palfrey</a> who, as far as I can tell, spends his days switching between Erlang and PHP to stop himself getting bored.</p>  <p>A fun day. Some really solid code. Some really interesting lessons learned. And there's a couple of us hanging out in #kaboomjs on Freenode over the next few days to get it finished off and up and running.</p>
