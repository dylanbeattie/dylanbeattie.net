<p>There's as many ways to lose at poker as there's ways to fail at delivering software, but one variation I have yet to experience is a game called <a href="http://www.horsepoker.net/">HORSE</a>. In HORSE, each hand follows a different set of rules - you'll play a hand of Hold'Em, a hand of Omaha, a hand of Razz, a hand of Stud, and a hand of Stud Hi-Lo; then you go back to the beginning and do it all over again, until my brother has all my chips.</p>  <p>Inspired by this, I've devised the following brilliant software methodology for all those teams who can't quite settle on a system that works for them. It's called WALKS, and you work in two-week sprints, using a different methodology for each sprint to ensure you get the maximum efficiency from all these wonderful processes and systems:</p>  <blockquote>   <p><strong>Weeks 1-2: Waterfall       <br /></strong>You spend the first two weeks making bold, ambitious, big-design-up-front plans, and not actually writing any code or shipping any features.</p> </blockquote>  <blockquote>   <p><strong>Weeks 3-4: Agile       <br /></strong>You spend the next two weeks trying desperately to get *something* built and releasable.</p> </blockquote>  <blockquote>   <p><strong>Weeks 5-6: Lean       <br /></strong>Realizing that your &quot;big design&quot; is probably killing your attempts to be agile, you start hacking out unnecessary features and trying to pare the design back to something you might actually be able to build.</p> </blockquote>  <blockquote>   <p><strong>Weeks 7-8: Kanban       <br /></strong>You still don't know what you're doing, so you decide to write everything on Post-It notes and stick them to a board, figuring that if you start pulling jobs off the queue, you might at least get *something* done.</p> </blockquote>  <blockquote>   <p><strong>Weeks 9-10: Scrum        <br /></strong>You have two weeks of daily stand-up meetings, in a desperate attempt to try and get a handle on things. Finally, you sit down on Friday afternoon, have a two-hour timeboxed retrospective, and decide that what you <em>really </em>need is a full set of requirements and a definitive spec.</p> </blockquote>  <p>Then you take a weekend off, come in on Monday, and start at the top again.</p>  <p>If that sounds familiar, it's OK - you're not hopelessly lost, confused or unproductive; you're just taking a structured approach to being multi-disciplinary...</p>  <p><font size="1">(This is a joke post. Please don't use WALKS to build software. Ever. The world has enough problems as it is...)</font></p>
