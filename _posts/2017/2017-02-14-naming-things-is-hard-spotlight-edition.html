Like most specialist industries, software is rife with mainstream English words that we’ve taken and misappropriated to mean something completely different. Show business is no different. The software team here at Spotlight sits smack-bang in the intersection between these two specialist fields, and so when we’re talking to our customers and product owners about the systems we build, it’s very important to understand the difference between typecasting and type casting, and exactly what sort of actor model we’re talking about. We therefore present this delightful “double glossary” of everyday terms that you’ll hear here at Spotlight Towers. Because as we all know, there’s only two hard problems in software: cache invalidation, naming things, and off-by-one errors.<br />
