<p>I was in Oslo earlier this month, where – as well as doing the opening keynote, a couple of talks, a workshop on hypermedia systems and PubConf – I had the chance to chat with <a href="https://twitter.com/sethjuarez">Seth Juarez</a> from Channel 9 about code, culture, speaking at conferences, and… all kinds of things, really.</p>
<p>The interview's here, or you can watch it over on <a href="https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/NDC/NDC-Oslo-2017/C9L02">Channel9.msdn.com</a> - thanks Seth and co for taking the time to put this together!</p> <iframe src="https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/NDC/NDC-Oslo-2017/C9L02/player" width="540" height="300" allowFullScreen frameBorder="0"></iframe>
