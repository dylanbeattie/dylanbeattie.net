<p>I'll be delivering a hands-on workshop at <a href="https://skillsmatter.com/conferences/6859-progressive-dotnet-2015#program">Progressive.NET 2015 at SkillsMatter</a> here in London next week, where I'll be talking about advanced REST architectural patterns, and actually implementing some of those patterns in .NET using several of the frameworks available for building HTTP/REST APIs on ASP.NET</p>  <p>I've tried quite hard to avoid any esoteric requirements, so attendees should only need</p>  <ul>   <li>A laptop running Visual Studio 2013, Powershell and IIS</li>    <li>A reasonable working knowledge of C# and HTTP</li>    <li>A test runner capable of running NUnit tests - personally I love <a href="http://www.ncrunch.net/">NCrunch</a> deeply but <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/">ReSharper</a> or plain old <a href="http://www.nunit.org/">NUnit</a> will do just fine./</li>    <li>Some familiarity with Git and GitHub - if you know how to fork a repo and clone it to your workstation, you should be fine.</li> </ul>  <p>The repo we'll be working from is <a title="https://github.com/dylanbeattie/Restival" href="https://github.com/dylanbeattie/Restival">https://github.com/dylanbeattie/Restival</a> - there shouldn't be a great deal of setup required, but if you want to clone the repository, check it compiles, and set up your local IIS endpoints by running <a href="https://github.com/dylanbeattie/Restival/blob/master/src/Deploy.ps1">deploy.ps1</a> ahead of time, it'll save a little time on the day.</p>  <p>During the workshop, we'll be discussing advanced HTTP/REST API patterns - hypermedia, pagination, resource expansion, HTTP PATCH, OAuth2 - and showing off some tools that can help us design and monitor our HTTP APIs. Alongside the discussion, we'll be implementing some of the techniques covered using your preferred choice of WebAPI, ServiceStack, OpenRasta or NancyFX - or even all four, if you're feeling productive - and then discussing the relative pros and cons of these frameworks for each of the patterns we're implementing.</p>  <p>See you there!</p>
