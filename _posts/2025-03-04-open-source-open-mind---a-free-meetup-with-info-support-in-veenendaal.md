On March 19th, I'll  be speaking at a free meetup in Veenendaal in the Netherlands, hosted by the wonderful folks over at [Info Support](https://www.infosupport.com/), all about the history - and future - of "free software". We're coming up on half a century of folks giving their code away for free, but we're still not entirely sure what "free software" is, how it works - or whether it's possible to create a truly sustainable ecosystem around free and open source software.

Come along and hear about the history of open source, free software, the GNU project, Commander Keen, WordPress, FluentAssertions, Redis... and more.
