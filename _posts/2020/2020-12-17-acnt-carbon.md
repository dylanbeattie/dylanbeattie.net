    summary: Carbon creates beautiful images of source code.
---

Source code is weird stuff. On one hand, it's just regular text with a whole lot of weird punctuation. On the other hand, it's indistinguishable from magic â€“ arcane spells and incantations that we use to control the lightning that we trapped inside the rocks, solving hundreds of millions of calculations in a heartbeat, sending images and sounds and ideas flying around the world...

Code is hard to read. Any experienced developer will relate to the experience of opening up a file you've not seen before and staring at it blankly, trying to figure out what's going on... why does a function called `JoinStrings` return an integer? What on earth does the `HelperManagerFactory` do? Why doesn't `Array.map` return a `Map`?

Alas, we haven't yet invented something that makes code readable... but today's [#Nerdvent](/nerdvent) tool can at least make it look good. It's a website called [Carbon](https://carbon.now.sh/), which I found thanks to [Kevlin Henney](https://twitter.com/KevlinHenney), which lets you *"create and share beautiful images of your source code."* And I mean, this thing is stunning. Just lovely. Here's part of my [solution to Advent of Code day 15](https://dylanbeattie.github.io/advent-of-code-2020/day15/index.html), using the [SynthWave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthwave) '84 theme and the [Fira Code font we saw the other day](https://dylanbeattie.net/advent2020/2020/12/10/aocnt-fira-code.html):

Isn't that glorious? You can almost smell the rain sizzling on the neon lights...

Here's Duff's Device, with the Blackboard theme and the JetBrains Mono font:

Carbon will export your code images as PNG or SVG files, which is great for making presentation slides - but if you want to embed them online, there's an IFRAME option as well, which gives you beautifully highlighted code that your readers can still copy & paste:

Carbon is over at [https://carbon.now.sh/](https://carbon.now.sh/) - check it out, give them a shout out on Twitter [@carbon_app](https://twitter.com/carbon_app), and have fun!
