A few years back, I had the singular experience of flying from Novosibirsk to London via Moscow, on the weekend that the clocks change. Novosibirsk is 4 hours ahead of Moscow and it's a 4-hour flight - so you get on a plane at 10pm and land four hours later, at 10pm, and then somewhere in the air between Sheremetyevo and Gatwick the UK jumps around by an hour and you land sometime in the morning completely discombobulated. 

Because, yeah, timezones. Just one more way in which 2020 has been an endless amount of fun - folks who used to spend half the year in airport lounges and hotels are now spending at at home, trying to keep up with all the events and meetings and people they would normally, and doing it all remote means lots of fun trying to schedule meetings and work out whether that conference you're going to has published their schedule on your time, their time, or UTC.

Enter WClock. It's a desktop clock for Windows computers. It supports multiple timezones, it's extremely customisable, it's "always on top" - so whenever I've been running a training course or speaking at a conference where we've got folks from multiple timezones joining, I'll take a moment to put all their clocks into my WClock so I can remember who's when.

My regular one currently looks like this:

Well, what, did you expect? High-def raytraced graphics and lots of lens flare? **It's a clock!** 

OK, here it is with some options:

It's wonderfully old school, it's simple, it works, and I've found it really, really useful. Check it out: [https://www.di-mgt.com.au/wclock/download.html](https://www.di-mgt.com.au/wclock/download.html)
