I'm throwing a party! It's been a bit of a rough year and with the new lockdown restrictions that have just kicked in across London
and parts of the UK, Christmas is basically cancelled for a lot of folks... so on Sunday 27th December, I'm going to stream a live show on the internet, including loads of my <a href="/music">parody songs</a>, some PubConf-style comedy lightning talks, a couple of musical surprises, and almost certainly a feline cameo or two from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPS-eFmdepw">Lionel</a>. 
<a href="/holodeck"><img class="do-not-autolink" src="/images/posts/2020-12-22-holidays-in-the-holodeck/holodeck.png" /></a>
<p>It's at Sunday December 27th, at 19:00 UTC. I'll be streaming for around 2 hours, then we'll have drinks on Zoom.</p>
<p>Want to add it to your Google calendar? <a href="https://www.google.com/calendar/render?action=TEMPLATE&text=Dylan+Beattie%27s+Holidays+in+the+Holodeck&details=An+evening+of+comedy%2C+music%2C+nerd+jokes+and+silliness%2C+performed+live+by+Dylan+Beattie+and+streamed+live+on+the+internet.&location=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitch.tv%2Fdylanbeattie&dates=20201227T190000Z%2F20201227T210000Z"> Here you go:<img border="0" style="display: block; margin: 8px auto; padding: 0; width: auto; height: auto; border: 0;" src="https://www.google.com/calendar/images/ext/gc_button1_en-GB.gif"></a></p>
<p>There's also a <a href="https://fb.me/e/3LxT0f759">Facebook event</a> for it if that's your thing, or if you want an ICS file, you can find one <a href="/miscellany/dylan-beattie-holidays-in-the-holodeck.ics">here</a></p>

It would be lovely to see you there. Well, I won't see you, obviously, 'cos that's not how streaming works. But you'll see me, and if you put a comment in the chat, I'll know you're out there, and that would make me (and Lionel) very happy.
