I'm a stickler for detail. If I'm taking screenshots to use in a blog post or a Powerpoint slide, I like to get the window I'm capturing to be exactly the right size and shape before I snap it. This used to involve a lot of very, very patient dragging - and then I found [Sizer](http://www.brianapps.net/sizer4/). It's a tiny Windows app that runs in the background until you right-click a window frame:

It's got loads of cool extra features as well - snap to grid, custom sizes, it'll move windows as well as resizing them. Check out the [user guide](http://www.brianapps.net/sizer/userguide.html) to see what else it can do.

Sizer is online at [http://www.brianapps.net/sizer4/](http://www.brianapps.net/sizer4/) - check it out.
