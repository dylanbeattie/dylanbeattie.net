On Saturday, pubs in England are allowed to reopen. I love pubs. I love pubs more than you can imagine. But there is no way in a million years I am going anywhere near a pub on a Saturday in the middle of summer, when they've all been closed for three months, and they're only opening now because the government think there's probably enough hospital beds to deal with the aftermath.

So instead of going to the pub on Saturday, I'm going to play a live rock show, from my house, and stream the whole thing live online. An hour or so of classic rock covers - AC/DC, Bon Jovi, Queen, Muse, Pink Floyd, Guns n' Roses, and maybe a few surprises. I'll be using a whole bunch of technology to put together something a bit special - if it works, it'll be awesome... if it doesn't work, it'll be probably be hilarious. Either way it'd be cool if you want to tune in.

Here's the invitation so you can add it to your calendar:

* [dylan-beattie-stay-in-rock-out.ics](/events/dylan-beattie-stay-in-rock-out.ics)

It all kicks off at 19:00 UK time this Saturday, July 4th. I'll be streaming live on [https://twitch.tv/dylanbeattie](https://twitch.tv/dylanbeattie), and on [facebook.com/dylanbeattie](https://facebook.com/dylanbeattie) and [youtube.com/dylanbeattie](https://youtube.com/dylanbeattie) as well - and then firing up a Zoom for the after-party. 

Get some beers in, crank up the volume, and let's have some fun. :)
