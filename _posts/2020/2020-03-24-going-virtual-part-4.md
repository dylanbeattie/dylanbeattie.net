So, [we're on lockdown](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/mar/23/uk-coronavirus-live-news-latest-boris-johnson-minister-condemns-people-ignoring-two-metre-distance-rule-in-parks-as-very-selfish). London, the city of ten million people I've called home for the last seventeen years, is closed. But thankfully, for most of us, life goes on, albeit in a form that would have been unrecognisable only weeks ago. And every day, more weird and wonderful situations and scenarios are bubbling to the surface of this strange, isolated and yet connected life that we all suddenly find ourselves living.

Back in July 2019, there was [a huge news story about the Zoom video conferencing software](https://www.wired.com/story/zoom-bug-webcam-hackers/), which apparently contained a vulnerability that allowed an attacker to remotely access your webcam over an insecure web server. This was so serious that Apple took the unprecedented step of issuing a macOS update that forcibly patched the vulnerability at the OS level.

Well, at the time, it wasn't *that* big a deal - many of us only used Zoom for the occasional remote meeting, and uninstalling it wasn't a huge inconvenience. But the events of the last month have dramatically changed the playing field, and Zoom has emerged as a very clear frontrunner for running all kinds of online events - virtual meetups, virtual pub nights, tabletop gaming sessions. 

Now, with this sudden surge in interest has come a renewed round of discussion around Zoom's privacy policies. Check out [this Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/Ouren/status/1241398181205889024), in particular the comments in replies like "[Zoom is indistinguishable from malware, and should be treated as such](https://twitter.com/FennelAurora/status/1241702991217950720)" (and notice that they're still citing a LinkedIn article from July 2019 as an authoritative source)

Now, I normally try to maintain a sort of friendly conversational tone in my online writing, but when I first saw this, I had exactly one thought. And I've reflected on it most of the day and my response is exactly the same, so here it is:

**THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE ARE DYING AND ENTIRE COUNTRIES ARE ON LOCKDOWN. DO YOU THINK ANYBODY GIVES A DAMN ABOUT ZOOM MONITORING YOUR ONLINE ACTIVITY RIGHT NOW?**

Zoom *works*. It enables conversations. You click a link, and there are your friends, on the screen, talking to you. There are countless thousands of people out there right now having to discover new ways to talk to their friends, talk to their families; provide moral and emotional support to loved ones who are self-isolated and hoping they're not going to die. And Twitter pops up and is all like 'OMG ZOOM IS MALWARE YOU MUST UNINSTALL IT AT ONCE'

No. People don't care about information security and privacy policies right now. When the choice is "eat junk food or starve to death", nobody wants to hear about how junk food isn't good for you. 

Sure, there's alternatives. There's even a fully open-source thing called [jitsi](https://jitsi.org/)  – which looks pretty promising, but I spent half an hour yesterday with two other experienced software developers trying to get a jitsi call working. It doesn't work in Edge. It doesn't work in Firefox. Even after we all tried using Chrome, we couldn't get to the point of being able to see and hear each other. And there's Whereby, and Hangouts, and Skype, and Discord, and Slack, and Remo, and WebEx, and and and and and... and none of them is quite as good as Zoom at making you feel like you're just hanging out talking with your people. And, perhaps most important of all, the people we are missing the most are probably not all that tech-savvy. Many of them have never done a video call before in their lives - and it's not like you can go round and help them set it up. This stuff needs to work. Simple, easy to explain, minimum configuration, and we work up from there.

If you want people to stop using Zoom at a time like this, build a better alternative. Not "better" in the sense of "kinda sucks but yay privacy" - you'd think after three decades of watching Linux fail to take over the desktop, the open source and privacy brigade would have realised that mainstream adoption has everything to do with user experience and very little to do with principles. If you want to win, make something **better**. "Better" in the sense of "easier to talk to grandma". "Better" in the sense of "easier to run an online meetup." "Better" in the sense of "your friends choose it to host your Thursday night online social". There's a huge opportunity here, if anybody really wants to do something with it; almost everybody I know is paying actual money for Zoom right now, because it works, and because there are bigger things to worry about in the world right now than somebody on Twitter saying that Zoom is malware.

Start with an absolutely bullet-proof rock-solid video chat that lets up to 100 people join the same meeting by clicking a URL. Not installing a different browser or configuring anything. Once you've solved *that*, here's a few features for starters that would make a compelling replacement for Zoom:

* Crop the video feeds to portrait, not landscape. They are LITERALLY PORTRAITS. I love my friends but I don't need them in widescreen.
* That slick virtual background feature? Why not send the video with the transparent background, so I can arrange all my participants on the same background? That's be amazing for doing remote meetups and presentations and wanting to feel like you're talking to a real audience.
* Ad-hoc breakout rooms. Let folks in a chat ping each other and break out into a separate chat - and let them choose whether the rest of the room can see it or not.

But, honestly, right now, a stable, reliable video chat platform is literally a lifeline for a lot of us out here. We're relying on video chat to sustain our businesses, communities and relationships whilst this thing is ongoing, and so far, Zoom is running rings around everything else in terms of features and call quality. It almost doesn't matter whether your concerns about security are justified or not; now is just not the time.
