I think we managed to cover a really great programme of topics – <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenRasta">OpenRasta</a>, <a href="http://blog.benhall.me.uk/">Ben Hall</a> using Ruby to test ASP.NET projects, <a href="http://mikehadlow.blogspot.com/">Mike Hadlow</a> talking about the <a href="http://www.castleproject.org/container/">Windsor IoC</a> container, <a href="http://www.jeremyskinner.co.uk/2010/04/01/fluentvalidation-presentation-london-wed-14-april/">Jeremy Skinner</a> presenting his <a href="http://fluentvalidation.codeplex.com/">FluentValidation</a> library (and a late apology from Neil Robbins, whose CouchDB talk had to be cancelled after his laptop went into ‘permanent hibernation’ at the last minute… I guess the long cold winter affects laptops as well as people)</p>  <p>I should make one very important clarification: <strong>dotLess is NOT my project!</strong> The original Ruby project was created by <a href="http://twitter.com/cloudhead">Alexis Sellier</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/usabilitypost">Dmitry Fadeyev</a>, and it was ported to .NET by <a href="http://enginechris.wordpress.com/">Christopher Owen</a>, <a href="http://blog.smoothfriction.nl/">Erik van Brakel</a> and <a href="http://www.tigraine.at/">Daniel Hoelbling</a>. Apologies if this wasn’t clear from the presentation – from the questions afterwards, I appear to have inadvertently given the impression I was one of the project contributors. I’m not; I just think it’s an awesome library and wanted to give it a bit of exposure.</p>  <p>You can download the demo code from last night’s talk here: </p>  <p>&#160;&#160;&#160; <a href="http://www.dylanbeattie.net/dot_less_demo.zip">http://www.dylanbeattie.net/dot_less_demo.zip</a>&#160;</p>  <p>You should just be able to unzip the whole lot into a folder, bring up LessDemo.sln in Visual Studio and hit “Run” – but let me know if you’re having any problems with it.</p>  <p>The other bits I spoke about in the talk are:</p>  <ul>   <li>Project Homepage and Downloads: <a href="http://www.dotlesscss.com/">http://www.dotlesscss.com/</a>      <br /></li>    <li>Ruby LESS Library: <a href="http://lesscss.org/">http://lesscss.org/</a>      <br /></li>    <li>Phil Haack’s T4 Template (.less to .css at build time):     <br />&#160;<a href="http://haacked.com/archive/2009/12/02/t4-template-for-less-css.aspx">http://haacked.com/archive/2009/12/02/t4-template-for-less-css.aspx</a>      <br /></li>    <li>Opening .less files in Visual Studio 2010’s CSS editor     <br /><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2346243/">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2346243/</a></li> </ul>  <p>Finally, I’m very excited to see that for the next version of LESS they’re migrating away from server-side Ruby and porting the entire library to Javascript – so you can run it client-side or server-side depending on your setup. Nothing’s officially released yet, but you can get download the latest source from the <a href="http://github.com/cloudhead/less.js/tree/">less.js project on GitHub</a> – definitely a project worth keeping an eye on.</p>
