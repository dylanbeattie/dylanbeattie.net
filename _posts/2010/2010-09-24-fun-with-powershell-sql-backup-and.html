<p>Our database backup system is based on taking a full backup of every database every night, and transaction log backups every 20 minutes. Backups are shipped offsite to a backup server sitting in a data-centre across town, and what I was trying to do was to automate the process of restoring the latest full backup and all subsequent transaction logs on the remote server.</p>  <p>So: ingredients. I have :</p>  <ul>   <li><a href="http://www.red-gate.com/products/SQL_Backup/">Red Gate SQL Backup</a> (and the SqlBackupC.exe command-line client) </li>    <li><a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-gb/scriptcenter/powershell.aspx">Windows Powershell</a> </li>    <li>A list of databases in a text file (“databases.txt”) </li>    <li>A&#160; folder full of database backups, and a folder full of transaction log backups. </li> </ul>  <p>The backup filenames look something like:</p>  <pre><blockquote><p>D:\backup\<br />&#160; data\<br />&#160;&#160;&#160; FULL_myserver_Animals_20100921_183021.sqb<br />&#160;&#160;&#160; FULL_myserver_Animals_20100922_183021.sqb<br />&#160;&#160;&#160; FULL_myserver_Animals_20100923_183021.sqb<br />&#160;&#160;&#160; FULL_myserver_Northwind_20100921_183021.sqb<br />&#160;&#160;&#160; FULL_myserver_Northwind_20100922_183021.sqb<br />&#160;&#160;&#160; FULL_myserver_Northwind_20100923_183021.sqb<br />&#160; logs\<br />&#160;&#160;&#160; LOG_myserver_Animals_20100921_190002.sqb<br />&#160;&#160;&#160; LOG_myserver_Animals_20100921_200004.sqb<br />&#160;&#160;&#160; LOG_myserver_Animals_20100921_210003.sqb<br />&#160;&#160;&#160; LOG_myserver_Animals_20100921_220002.sqb<br />&#160;&#160;&#160; LOG_myserver_Animals_20100921_230005.sqb<br />&#160;&#160;&#160; ...<br />&#160;&#160;&#160; ...</p></blockquote></pre>

<p>So. Powershell… time to see what all the fuss is about. </p>

<p>Let’s start with a couple of things that threw me until I got my head around them. Powershell is a <strong><em>shell</em>.</strong> Don’t think of it like C# or Java – think of it like a batch file on steroids. With objects. If you want to run a program from a Powershell script, you <strong>just put its name in the script.</strong> For example – this is a valid Powershell script that’ll open itself in Notepad:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>C:\Windows\System32\Notepad.exe myscript.ps1</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Copy that line into notepad, save it as as myscript.ps1, fire up Powershell.exe, navigate to the folder where you saved it, and type .\myscript.ps1 – bingo.</p>

<p>Secondly, Powershell is designed so that <strong>if something has a certain meaning in DOS, it’ll mean the same thing in Powershell</strong>. &lt;, | and &gt; will redirect and pipe output – just like in DOS – which means Powershell can’t use &gt; as the greater-than operator – so they’ve used –ge instead. (Mmm. Perly.) Backslashes are path separators – just like in DOS – so Powershell uses the backtick (<strong>`</strong>) as an escape character. </p>

<p>Thirdly, Powershell supports Perl-style string interpolation.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>$foo = 10 
    <br />echo “I have $foo fingers”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>will output <strong>“I have 10 fingers”</strong>. To avoid this behaviour, use single-quotes instead:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>$foo = 10 
    <br />echo 'I have $foo fingers'</p>
</blockquote>

<p>will print "<strong>I have $foo fingers” </strong>Be careful, though – underscores are valid in variable names, so </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>echo “LOG_$server_$catalog_$timestamp”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>is actually going to try and find variables called $server_ , $catalog_ and $timestamp. To work around this behaviour, enclose the variable name in braces:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>echo “LOG_${server}_${catalog}_${timestamp}”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Finally – Powershell supports aliases, which means most commands have more than one name. For example, there’s a built-in command <strong>Get-ChildItem – </strong>and <strong>dir</strong>, <strong>gci</strong>, and <strong>ls</strong> are all shortcuts for this command, so when you bring up a Powershell command and want to list the contents of the current directory, it doesn’t care whether you type dir, ls, gci, or Get-ChildItem – they all do exactly the same thing.</p>

<p>OK. Time for scripty fun. Here’s the script – you’ll need to supply your own databases.txt and credentials, and probably tweak the </p>

<p>Having never really used Powershell before, this whole thing took about three hours to put together – and I spent the first two hours cursing Powershell for being so damned awkward, and then it just <em>clicked </em>and suddenly everything made a lot more sense. Hopefully the tips above will save you a bit of frustration if you’re taking your first steps with it… and I’ve a feeling I’m going to be doing a lot more Powershelling before too long. For stuff like this, it’s so much more powerful than batch files, and so much more maintainable than writing little command-line utilities in C#.</p>
