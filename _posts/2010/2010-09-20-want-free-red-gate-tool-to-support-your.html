<p>Earlier in the year, I helped Red Gate software out with some customer focus group stuff, and in return they’ve offered me a free license to any single Red Gate software tool </p>  <p>Since I’m already a happily-licensed user of Red Gate’s SQL Toolbelt and most of their .NET tools, I thought I’d pass this generous gesture on to the .NET community, so here’s the deal. </p>  <blockquote>   <p><strong>If you maintain an open-source .NET project, and you’d like a free license for any single Red Gate tool, drop me a short e-mail, tell me about your project, tell me which tool you’d like, and why it would be useful.</strong></p> </blockquote>  <p><a href="http://www.red-gate.com/"><img style="border-right-width: 0px; margin: 0px 0px 20px 20px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" align="right" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_de7B8BtZZIw/TJeO8bWnLPI/AAAAAAAAADM/8bCORYvw3bo/image%5B5%5D.png?imgmax=800" width="240" height="89" /></a>There is a single license up for grabs, for any of the tools listed on Red Gate’s products page at <a href="http://www.red-gate.com/products/index.htm">http://www.red-gate.com/products/index.htm</a></p>  <p>I’m not looking for ten-page essays – if your project is well-known, just tell me which tool you’d like and how it will help. E-mail your entry to <a href="mailto:dylan@dylanbeattie.net">dylan@dylanbeattie.net</a> – please put “Red Gate Giveaway” in the subject line so they don’t end up in the spam folder, and remember to include your full name &amp; e-mail so I can let you know if you’ve won. I’ll accept entries until this Friday, October 1st, at 10:00am (GMT), after which I’ll pick a winner and send their details across to Red Gate. </p>  <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wil_Wheaton#Wheaton.27s_Law">Wheaton’s Law</a> applies; my decision is final, no correspondence will be entered into, etc, etc. Good luck!</p>
