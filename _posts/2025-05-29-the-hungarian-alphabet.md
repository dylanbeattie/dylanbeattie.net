As you might know, I like alphabets. And typography, and fonts, and text encoding systems, and just about everything to do with getting the written word into some sort of computer system and seeing if it comes out the other end with its bits intact. 

I'm at the Craft conference in Budapest this week, where later today I'll be talking about plain text, and how it doesn't actually exist, and when I give this talk, it's always nice to put a bit of a local spin on it.
