Martin is apparently dubious as to just how awesome Sveltia CMS is. (Martin also apparently isn't entirely sure of the difference between Sveltia and Svelte, but I'm sure he'll figure it out eventually).

For the record, he made this comment at 18:29 UTC on 2025-02-27.

20 minutes? I make that 3 minutes, plus another 2 for GitHub Actions to build and publish the site.
