<p>A huge thank you to everyone who came along to my ReST talk here at NDC London. Links to a couple of resources you might find useful:</p> <ul> <li>The <a href="https://github.com/dylanbeattie/ndc-london-2016/raw/master/The%20Rest%20of%20ReST%20-%20Dylan%20Beattie%20-%20NDC%20London%202016.pdf">slide deck from my presentation</a> is on Github (PDF)</li> <li>Roy Fielding’s dissertation, ‘<a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/top.htm">Architectural Styles and the Design of Network-based Software Architectures</a>’, in which he outlines the constraints of representational state transfer (ReST). Highly recommended and remarkably readable.</li> <li>The <a href="http://stateless.co/hal_specification.html">HAL – Hypertext Application Language</a> site and draft specification</li> <li>A great article from Stormpath on <a href="https://stormpath.com/blog/linking-and-resource-expansion-rest-api-tips/">linking and resource expansion in REST APIs</a>.</li> <li>The <a href="http://oauth.net/2/">OAuth2.0 site</a> and specification</li></ul> <p>Thanks again for coming – and any comments, questions or feedback, you’ll find me on Twitter as <a href="https://twitter.com/dylanbeattie">@dylanbeattie</a>.</p>
