<p>A version of my talk from PubConf London, “The Face of Things to Come”, is now online. This isn’t a recording of the actual talk – the audio has been recorded specially, one slide has been replaced for copyright reasons, and a couple of things have been fixed in the edit – but it’s close enough.</p> <p align="center"><iframe height="281" src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/152890042" frameborder="0" width="500" allowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen></iframe></p> <p align="center"><a href="https://vimeo.com/152890042">The Face of Things to Come</a> from <a href="https://vimeo.com/dylanbeattie">Dylan Beattie</a> on <a href="https://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.</p> <p>As always, the only way to improve as a speaker is to listen to your audience, so I would love to hear your comments or feedback – leave a comment, <a href="mailto:dylan@dylanbeattie.net">email me</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/dylanbeattie">ping me on Twitter</a>. </p>
