      src="http://pubconf.io/img/logo.gif" width="128" align="right" height="131"></a>Next Saturday January 16th, some
  of the best speakers in the IT industry – and me – will be appearing at PubConf, a single-track, rapid-fire
  conference. A series of five-minute Ignite-style talks, curated around three themes that we hope are relevant and
  familiar to anybody who does “computering” – managing yourself; the future of computering, and ranting about broken
  things. </p>
<p>I’ll be talking about “The Face Of Things To Come” on the computering track – all about recent advances in computer
  vision, face detection and recognition, emotion analysis, and how I think this kind of technology is going to change
  the world. For real, this time.</p>
<p>It promises to be a really great event – and it’s completely absolutely free. Yep, free-as-in-beer free. Read more
  about it at <a href="http://pubconf.io/">pubconf.io</a>, and get your tickets at <a
