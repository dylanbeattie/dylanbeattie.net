I'm going to be heading out to Portugal in January to speak at some free meetups – if you're 
in Lisbon or Porto and want to kick off 2020 with some cool tech events, come along! I'm gonna be in [Porto on January 7th](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/ndc-meetup-with-dylan-beattie-farfetch-porto-tickets-85068182223) and [Lisbon on January 8th](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/ndc-meetup-with-dylan-beattie-farfetch-lisbon-tickets-85618592515) talking about the secrets to happy code. It's a talk that covers a whole range of ideas, from psychology and neurochemistry to user experience design, logging and monitoring, and how we developers can use those ideas to ship better software and create happier teams. Plus pizza, drinks, awesome people and plenty of time to chat.

Thanks to [NDC Conferences](https://ndc-conferences.com) for putting the whole thing together, and to [Farfetch](https://farfetchtechblog.com/en/) for hosting. And if you like the sound of this, you should check out [NDC Porto](https://ndcporto.com/) – two days of workshops and two days of conferences with a fantastic lineup of international speakers, all set in one of the most beautiful cities I've ever visited.

The January meetups are free, but you'll need to register if you're coming along:

* [Porto on January 7th](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/ndc-meetup-with-dylan-beattie-farfetch-porto-tickets-85068182223)
* [Lisbon on January 8th](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/ndc-meetup-with-dylan-beattie-farfetch-lisbon-tickets-85618592515) 

And if anyone wants to join me for [francesinhas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francesinha) after the Porto meetup, I'm definitely up for that. :)
