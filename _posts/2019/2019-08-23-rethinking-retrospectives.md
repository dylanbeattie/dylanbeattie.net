title: Rethinking Retrospectives
---

The retrospective is one of those ideas that started out in [Scrum](https://www.scrumguides.org/) as part of a formal framework, but has gained a lot of traction among teams who work in iterations, whether they're following a formal Scrum process or just trying to ship stuff every two weeks and then figure out what's next. Regardless of how your team is organised, I think there's a lot of value in making time regularly to reflect on how you're doing, identify opportunities for improvement and draw up lists of actions for things you'd like to try in the next iteration and see what impact they have.

Now, any retrospective is only going to work if you can create a safe environment around the conversation. People need to be able to share the things that they find frustrating – blockers, issues, obstacles. If you can't talk about it, it won't improve. We all make mistakes – it's about whether your team and your culture regards mistakes as failures, or as opportunities to learn and improve. A big part of this is to focus your discussion on behaviours and outcomes, not on people – don't talk about who did what, talk about what actually happened and work backwards. Encourage people to step up. You may even reach a wonderful tipping point where, following an incident, you find that instead of everybody on the team trying to blame each other, everybody is trying to claim responsibility for themselves; developers are talking about how they could have detected the defect earlier with better testing or improved code review process; QA is talking about how they could improve their regression testing, managers are asking if assigning more people or more budget to the team would help. That's a great place to aim for, because that's where you really start to see results.

But today, I want to talk about one of the things that can make a huge difference to a retro, and that's boredom. A retro is normally at the end of a sprint, and often held towards the end of the working day, when people are tired and looking forward to going home (or to the pub.)

For a long time, all the retrospectives that I was involved with followed the Scrum process, which is based around three things:

* What went well?
* What
