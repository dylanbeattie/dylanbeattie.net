On July 6th and 7th, I'm running a [live online workshop with the folks from fwdays](https://urs.tl/dsnet-fwdays-202106), all about designing and building distributed systems with .NET. It's an introductory workshop aimed at developers who have some familiarity with C# and .NET; over two four-hour sessions, we're going to look at:

* Building HTTP APIs using REST and .NET WebAPI
* GraphQL, SPAs, and the "backends for frontends" (BFF) pattern
* Message queues, RabbitMQ, and the pub/sub pattern
* Remote procedure calls with gRPC
* Realtime browser communication using SignalR

Check out the video below for more info about what we'll be learning and how it all works.

It's a fully online workshop, using a combination of Zoom, Slack, and Visual Studio LiveShare; we'll discuss the principles and patterns involved in designing distributed systems, and then actually implement them so you can see how they work in practice. Attendees will implement their own services and endpoints, and by the end of the workshop we'll be running a live system, sending real requests and messages across the internet between us in real time to see how it all fits together.

Here's what previous attendees had to say about this workshop:

> *"Extremely professional... I have been a developer for just two years so all of this is pretty new to me even though I've touched on some of the topics a little bit in the past. It was a great overview and it made me more confident that I'll be able to actually use these technologies when the opportunity will rise."*
>
> *"I liked the fact that everything was put into action. Seeing the code helps us understand how should work."*
>
> *"The live coding is really great, it's more engaging than just being shown some pre-written code. But generally enjoyed all of it, you explain things really well"*
>
> *"The delivery is easy to follow, and the examples and code along bits are really helpful"*

That's happening on July 6th and 7th, 2021; 4pm-8pm Ukraine time / EEST (that's 2pm-6pm if you're in the UK)

Tickets start at 3900 UAH (about €120), and are on sale now from **fwdays**:
