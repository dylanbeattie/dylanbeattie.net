There is a place in the Netherlands called ['s-Hertogenbosch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%27s-Hertogenbosch). Yes, that's not a typo. Its official legal place name begins with an apostrophe. The locals all call it Den Bosch (and never, ever mention that you won't find Den Bosch on a map 'cos why would anybody possibly need to know that?)

And, seeing it on a railway departure board earlier this morning, it occurs to me that if there's anywhere in the world that figured out a lot of database stuff right from day 1, it's probably the good people of 's-Hertogenbosch.

_(obviously and shamelessly stolen from [https://xkcd.com/327/](https://xkcd.com/327/) so if you like it go and buy one of Randall's books or something. The [anniversary edition of What If?](https://xkcd.com/what-if/) is particularly good.)_
