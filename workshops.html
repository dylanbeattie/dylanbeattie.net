  <p>I've been running classroom training for software professionals since 2016. Drawing on over
    15 years' experience designing large-scale software applications, running software development
    teams, and speaking at meetups and conferences, I've taught developers to build hypermedia APIs,
    I've run a fast-track 'introduction to .NET Core' course aimed at developers looking to switch
    to the Microsoft .NET platform, and I run workshops aimed at helping
    software professionals improve their communication and presentation skills.</p>
