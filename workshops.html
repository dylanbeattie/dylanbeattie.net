    <h2>Workshops and Training</h2> 
<p>I've been running classroom training for software professionals since 2016. Drawing on over 
  15 years' experience designing large-scale software applications, running software development 
  teams, and speaking at meetups and conferences, I've taught developers to build hypermedia APIs, 
  I've run a fast-track 'introduction to .NET Core' course aimed at developers looking to switch
  to the Microsoft .NET platform, and I run workshops aimed at helping
  software professionals improve their communication and presentation skills.

<h2>Online Workshops for 2020</h2>
<p>The following workshops are now available <em>fully online</em>. For online courses, attendees will need a microphone, webcam and a good internet connection; teaching
will be done via video chat systems such as Zoom, WebEx Meetings or Jitsi, depending on the class, and group work and exercises have all been 
adapted to work with online collaboration tools.</p>
