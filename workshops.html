    <h2>Workshops and Training</h2> 
<p>I've been running classroom training for software professionals since 2016. Drawing on over 
  15 years' experience designing large-scale software applications, running software development 
  teams, and speaking at meetups and conferences, I've taught developers to build hypermedia APIs, 
  I've run a fast-track 'introduction to .NET Core' course aimed at developers looking to switch
  to the Microsoft .NET platform, and I'm currently offering two workshops aimed at helping
  software professionals improve their communication and presentation skills.
