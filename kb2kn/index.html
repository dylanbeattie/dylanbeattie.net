<p>I've delivered keynote presentations at conferences all over the world: NDC, JFokus, BuildStuff, DotNext, YOW!, and many more. In this 2-part workshop, I'll teach you everything I know about how to create and deliver great presentations for technical audiences, whether you're speaking at industry conferences, doing a talk at your local meetup group, or just sharing ideas with your own team.</p>

      “I loved Dylan's energy and passion. I also took away loads of practical ways to improve my speaking skills.”
</blockquote>
<h3>Part 1: Structure and Content</h3>
<ul>
    <li>How to design a talk: gather ideas, create a structure, figure out what works.</li>
    <li>Understanding constraints: format, timing, audiences</li>
    <li>Tools and techniques: language, rhetoric, storytelling, humour</li>
    <li>Effective rehearsal, dealing with nerves</li>
</ul>

<h3>Part 2: Slides and Media</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Creating effective slide decks: how to avoid “death by PowerPoint”</li>
    <li>Images, animation and photography</li>
    <li>Working with live demos</li>
    <li>Video and multimedia</li>
</ul>
<blockquote class="testimonial">
      “I've done speaker training type things in the past so the material was not really new, but Dylan's way of presenting it is just SO MUCH better than previous training sessions.”
</blockquote>

<p>During each session, you'll prepare and deliver a short presentation of your own, on a topic of your choice - anything goes; it doesn't have to be related to tech. I'll collate feedback from the group and share this with you along with my own notes and suggestions.</p>

<h2>Target Audience and Prerequisites</h2>
<p>This workshop is suitable for anybody who is looking to begin public speaking, or to improve their presentation technique.</p>
<p>Around 25% of the workshop is specifically focused on presenting software code and technology; the rest of the workshop is applicable to presentations on any topic and to any kind of audience.</p>
<p>Attendees will need access to a presentation tool. I recommend Microsoft PowerPoint – most examples are presented in PowerPoint, and the course includes some specific discussion around using PowerPoint for creating animation effects and slide transitions – but for the attendee presentations element of the workshop, Keynote or a web-based solution will work just fine.</p>
