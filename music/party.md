If I'm speaking at your conference, and you're throwing some kind of attendee party, and you'd like an *awesome* live music comedy show... you've come to the right place.

> Want to book a full band for your show? Who are all also amazing tech speakers with great content and sessions? Check out [The Linebreakers!](https://linebreakers.band/)

I can play anywhere from 45 minutes to 2 hours of tech-themed rock'n'roll parody songs - check out [dylanbeattie.net/music](/music) to see the kind of thing I'm talking about.

I sing, play electric guitar and harmonica. Backing tracks and videos are played from my laptop. You'll need to provide:

* A stage or performance area
* A stereo PA system with line-in or jack connectors *(NOT HDMI audio!)*
* A projector or big screen, with an HDMI video connection available from the stage

> I play **loud rock music**. This isn't background music. It's a show: a memorable, sing-along experience that your attendees will still be talking about when they come back next year. If you want nice chill vibes while people are chatting and networking, this is not the show for you. 

The show works great when the party is offsite at a bar or club that's normally used for live music, but I can also make it work if your party is onsite at the conference venue.

*If you're paying me a speaker fee / honorarium to present at your event, or if I'm running a workshop at your event that's on a profit-share basis, then I'll throw in the party show for free. If not, you'll have to pay. How much? Whatever it costs to get a plumber out for four hours on a Thursday evening. ðŸ˜‰*
