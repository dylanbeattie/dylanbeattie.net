  <h2>Live Music - Tech Specification</h2>
  <p>Here's what you'll need to provide for me to play live at your party or other event.</p>
  <hr />
  <h3>Essentials</h3>
  <dl>
    <dt>PA system</dt>
    <dd>My show requires a good-quality PA system suited to the size of the room, with <em>no latency</em>.</dd>
    <dt>A projector and screen, with a cabled HDMI connection available from the stage.</dt>
    <dd>My show is audiovisual and the videos are an essential part of the performance.</dd>
  </dl>
  <hr />
  <h3>Nice To Have</h3>
  <p>If you're able to provide these, brilliant. If not, please let me know in advance and we can work around it.</p>
  <dl>
    <dt>On-stage monitor wedges</dt>
    <dd>If possible, a feed of the front-of-house sound mix into a pair of monitor wedges.</dd>
  </dl>
  <hr />
  <h3>Showstoppers</h3>
  <p>I'm generally pretty flexible and will find a way to make things work - but there's a couple of things
    I've come across that just make it impossible to play a good show. If any of these is likely to be an
    issue, please let me know ahead of time and we can work something out.
  </p>
  <dl>
    <dt>Bluetooth-based audio systems</dt>
    <dd>Some auditoriums (particularly cinema screens) use a wireless Bluetooth-based audio system. This introduces
      too much latency into the sound signal and makes it impossible to keep time when playing live.
    </dd>
    <dt>Wireless screen-sharing</dt>
    <dd>I run the show via an HDMI connection from my Macbook Pro. I can run VGA, DVI or Mini DisplayPort,
      but wireless 'video casting' o software-based screen sharing introduce too much latency between the audio and the video.</dd>
    <dt>Adjoining events running at the same time</dt>
    <dd>I play loud rock music. Having the venue manager turn it down because our party is in Room A and
      there's a Bible study group in Room B next door puts a bit of a downer on things.</dd>
