Dylan wrote his first web page in 1992 and never looked back. He's been building data-driven web applications since the 1990s, and has worked on everything from tiny standalone websites to complex distributed systems. He's the CTO at Skills Matter in London, he's a Microsoft MVP, and he's a regular speaker at conferences and user groups, where he's spoken about topics from continuous delivery and Conway's Law to the history of the web and hypermedia APIs. When he's not wrangling code, Dylan plays guitar and writes songs. He's online at www.dylanbeattie.net and on Twitter as @dylanbeattie.
