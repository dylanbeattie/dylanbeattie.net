  <h1>Projects</h1>
  <p>Various open-source software projects I've created over the years - some genuinely useful, some just stuff I've put
    together for fun.</p>
  <h3>The "Rockstar" Programming Language</h3>
  <p>I'm the creator of Rockstar, an esoteric programming language designed to allow you to write valid programs that
    are
    also song lyrics.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://codewithrockstar.com/">codewithrockstar.com</a> - including an online Rockstar interpreter</li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/RockstarLang/Rockstar/">project repo on GitHub</a></li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Callisto: A Playlist Creator for Spotify</h3>
  <p>A web app I built that uses the Spotify API to create playlists by pasting lists of songs, or importing a set list
    from setlist.fm</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="http://callisto.azurewebsites.net/">Callisto</a></li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Reflexif: Parsing EXIF metadata with C# and System.Drawing</h3>
  <p>A .NET application that demonstrates HTML5 drag'n'drop file upload, instant image thumbnail display, working with EXIF metadata using System.Drawing, and watermarking images with copyright information based on embedded EXIF metadata.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="http://reflexif.azurewebsites.net/">live demo at reflexif.azurewebsites.net/</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/dylanbeattie/reflexif">project repo on GitHub</a></li>
  </ul>
  <h3>ElmahASP</h3>
  <p>A module I created for capturing runtime errors from classic ASP and passing them to ELMAH - invaluable if 
    you're still running some classic ASP code alongside your .NET stuff and want to consolidate your errors in
    one place for easier reporting.
