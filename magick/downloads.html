<p>This page provides compiled binaries of the <a href="http://www.imagemagick.org/">ImageMagick</a>
  image processing library for Windows 2000. These packages may also work on Windows
  NT, 95, 98, Me and XP, but have not been tested on these platforms.</p>
<p>The files here are provided purely for convenience. I do not undertake to support
  these files, nor do I promise to answer questions relating to these files. If
  you're having specific problems - broken downloads, file not found, etc. - then
  please let me know. For help on installation, see <a href="http://www.dylanbeattie.net/magick/">http://www.dylanbeattie.net/magick/</a>
  if you haven't already - otherwise direct all queries to the mailing list at
  magick-users@imagemagick.org</p>
<p>The files here were built using Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0, following the build
  instructions included in the standard ImageMagick distribution. The PPM files
  were compiled according to the <a href="http://www.dylanbeattie.net/magick/">instructions
  on this site.</a> They are provided merely as a convenience for people who don't
  have the software, the resources or the time to compile their own packages.

<h4>A Word On Versions</h4>
<p>Many users, particularly those from a pure Windows background, find the ImageMagick
  packages a little confusing at first. ImageMagick itself is not a program or
  an application - it's a set of functions for manipulating images that's distributed
  as a collection of DLLs. A system which has ImageMagick installed means that
  these DLL packages are present and available for other programs to utilise -
  if you've ever used software which complains about needing VBRUN300.DLL, then
  you'll know what this means :) Until you have some software that can call these
  DLLs, you can't actually *do* anything with ImageMagick.</p>
<p>Some people use the ImageMagick libraries to develop their own software, but
  most of us are interested in using them to manipulate image files. To this end,
  there are a number of different pieces of software (known as <i>interfaces</i>)
  which provide a mechanism for accessing the functions in the ImageMagick library.</p>
<p>The most common of these is the command-line tools. This is a set of executables
  (animate.exe, mogrify.exe, convert.exe, etc.) which you can run from the Windows
  command line or call from batch files, etc. </p>
<p>This page also hosts binary distributions of PerlMagick - an interface which
  allows you to call ImageMagick functions from within Perl scripts. </p>
<p>If you're running Windows, you've never heard of Perl or APIs or DLLs and you
  just want to convert your images from one format to another, you want the <a href="download/latest/ImageMagick.zip">ImageMagick
  (full) </a>distribution.</p>

<h3>Latest Binaries (currently 5.4.6)</h3>
<table width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="5" bordercolor="#FFFFFF" bgcolor="#FFCCCC">
  <tr>
    <td><font size="2"><b>NOTE</b>: Binaries of 5.4.4 and 5.4.5 downloaded before
      2002-05-30 have some strange dependency issues. If you're having problems
      with these binaries (such as needing MSVCR70.DLL), please download fresh
      copies and try again. This is entirely my fault, so apologies all round.
      :)</font></td>

<p>As of version 5.4.5, the distributions below are built with an <b>8-bit quantum
  depth. </b>If you don't know what this means, don't worry. If you specifically
  need 16-bit quantum support, binaries are available <a href="download/latest/q16/">here</a>.</p>
<dl>
<dt><a href="download/latest/PerlMagick-full.zip">PerlMagick PPM (full)</a></dt>
  <dd>This includes the Perl module and <b>all</b> supporting ImageMagick files.
    It is recommended for installation on systems which require only PerlMagick
    (eg. web servers). <b>This is all you need to install PerlMagick.</b></dd>
<dt><a href="download/latest/ImageMagick.zip">ImageMagick (full)</a></dt>
  <dd>This includes the ImageMagick binaries, including the command-line tools
    (animate.exe, composite.exe, etc.) Get this package if you want to use ImageMagick
    on a Windows system but don't want to use Perl. <b>This is functionally identical
    to the official ImageMagick Win2K binary distribution.</b></dd>
<dt><a href="download/latest/PerlMagick.zip">PerlMagick PPM (module only)</a></dt>
<dd>This includes only the PPM module. Get this package if you want to add PerlMagick to a system which already has the ImageMagick libraries installed.</dd>
</dl>

<h3>Installation Instructions</h3>
<p>To install PerlMagick, please read the PerlMagick Howto <a href="howto.html">here</a></p>
<p>To install the ImageMagick (full) package, (including the command-line binaries
  - animate.exe, convert.exe, mogrify.exe, etc.)</p>
<ol>
  <li>Unzip the contents of ImageMagick.zip into a directory on your local filesystem,
    eg c:\imagemagick.</li>
  <li>Set the MAGICK_HOME variable to point to this path, and ensure this directory
    has been added to your system path - this is easiest done by right-clicking
    'My Computer', Properties, Advanced, Environment Variables...</li>
</ol>
<p><b>NOTE</b>: Certain versions of Windows include a built-in utility called
  'convert.exe' (a disk format conversion tool). If you get an error about 'Must
  specify a filesystem' when trying to convert images, it means that Windows is
  finding it's own version of convert.exe before it finds the ImageMagick version.
  There are three ways around this:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Ensure that your ImageMagick directory is *before* your WINNT\system32 directory
    in your system path</li>
  <li>Rename the Windows version of convert to something like fsconvert.exe. I
    always do this, since I convert images on a daily basis but I've never converted
    a filesystem in my life :)</li>
  <li>Rename the ImageMagick convert.exe to something like iconvert.exe or imageconvert.exe.
  </li>
</ol>

<h3>Old Binaries</h3>
<p>Note: The ImageMagick releases use a four-part version number - eg. 5.2.6-3
  indicates major version 5, minor version 2, release 6, revision 3. Revisions
  indicate bug-fixes only - ie. 5.4.3-6 does exactly the same things as 5.4.3-1,
  but with less bugs. I keep one build of each release, but bug-fix releases will
  replace any earlier version of that release. As of April 2002, all archived
  binaries will be the latest revision of their version. Older versions - I have
  no idea which revision they are, so you're on your own :)</p>
