**WhatsApp, Web3, and Wordle: Evolving a Digital Society**
We live in a networked world. Between our laptops, our phones, and the smart gadgets in our kitchen, many of us are online 24/7. We work and play, communicate and collaborate, across digital networks powered by open protocols - the standards and specifications that form the backbone of the modern internet.
But within the last decade, we've seen many online interactions move away from open protocols and onto closed platforms. We've abandoned SMS for Signal and WhatsApp, we've abandoned email in favour of Slack, Teams, and Discord; restaurants use Instagram and Facebook instead of running their own websites. And, most of the time, it works â€“ but as more and more of our digital experiences are mediated by corporations and the platforms they control, what does this mean for the future of the internet? Amidst all the hype about "web 3" and the "metaverse", let's take a moment to remind ourselves how we got here, and remember what's at stake. We'll look back at the promise of "web 2.0" and what it actually delivered, we'll talk about digital identity and net neutrality - and we'll learn what the Apollo/Soyuz space missions have to do with the digital protocols that underlie our connected society.
Is internet access a fundamental human right?
That might sound like the sort of hypothetical questions that they talk about on panel shows on late-night TV, but a few weeks ago, it became a very real and immediate question. Following Russia's illegal invasion of Ukraine, the Ukrainian Minister of Digital ??? wrote a letter to ICANN, the Internet Consortium for Assigned Names and Numbers, asking them to effectively disconnect Russia from the internet.
ICANN's fairly rapid response basically boiled down to "we can't, and even if we could, we wouldn't" - but watching the discussion around it online started me thinking about the idea of internet access as a fundamental right. Because the concept of rights is very closely associated with the concept of freedom, and as I'm sure you all know, freedom is actually much more complicated than it looks.
The UDHR identifies two kinds of freedom. Freedom to and freedom from. Freedom to is about protecting your right, as an individual, to actively do the things you want to do. Freedom to choose a name, freedom to travel, freedom to form relationships, start a family. Freedom from is about protecting people from things we have, generally, agreed are bad things. Slavery, torture, persecution. And almost every article of the famous Universal Declartion of Human Rights fits quite neatly into one of those categories.
Except, perhaps, Article 19: "Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers."
Now, that was written in 1948. It's part of a series of 30 articles that were signed and ratified by almost every country in the world, except a few who, let's face it, were a bit busy in 1948 being awful bastards... Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Russia, and, interestingly, the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic. And so when article 19 was drafted, "seeking information and ideas through any media" meant radio, books, television, newspapers, the freedom to read what you want, talk to whoever you want to.
But then the internet came along. And the internet - as opposed to the World Wide Web - has been around a lot longer than most people think. The modern internet evolved directly from a research project called ARPAnet, which first came online in the late 1969 - the same year as the moon landings, the Boeing 747, and the Lockheed SR71. And to think that all those things were designed without Slack or Jira... amazing.
So when you talk about being connected to the internet, what do you actually mean? And perhaps more significantly, if we talk about disconnecting somebody - or maybe even an entire country - from the internet, what exactly are we talking about?
Let's start with the most fundamental unit of connectivity. An IP address. When you switch on your phone, or plug in your shiny new broadband router, the first thing it needs to do is acquire a network address. Without a network address, you can't do anything...





Now, the thing you have to remember about fundamental human rights is that there are only two answers to that question. there's yes, it is. And there are a lot of very complicated ways of saying "no", which normally boil down to particular groups of individuals trying to come up with a very roundabout way of saying "you can't take it away from ME but there are these other people who I think shouldn't be allowed to have it".
The Universal Declaration of Human Rights was ratified in 1948, long before the internet existed. But Article 19 of that declaration states that "Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers."
Seek, receive, and impart information and ideas through any media, and regardless of frontiers.
