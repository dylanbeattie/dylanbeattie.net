<h1>Thee Jubilee Hogge-Roaste</h1>
<h2>Episode 2: Sunday</h2>
<p class="preamble">(in which our intrepid heroes burn 100kg of coal, roast a hog, eat it, get drunk and pass out.)</p>

<p align="left"><a href="fullsize/DCP01108.jpg"><a href="fullsize/DCP01108.jpg"><img border="0" src="thumbs/DCP01108.jpg" width="300" height="225" align="left"></a></a><a href="fullsize/DCP01109.jpg"><img border="0" src="thumbs/DCP01109.jpg" width="225" height="300" align="right"></a>The
  sun dawns on a clear, bright day, one of those days that reminds you that 'not
  a cloud in the sky' isn't just a metaphor. As the tendrils of the dawn creep
  across the sleeping landscape, they fall on two prone figures. One lies beneath
  a bar, his air mattress having long since deflated, the cold stone digging into
  his shoulders as the warmth of the morning sun slaps him gently around the face
  and shouts 'wake up you drunken bastard.' His companion sleeps in a chair, fully
  clothed, the only signs of sleeping being his measured breathing and the fact
  he hasn't shouted at anybody for at least an hour. Although our intrepid heroes
  would gladly retire somewhere dark with a bottle of something potent and a large
  quantity of cigarettes, there is work to be done. Soon, the starving masses
  will be clamouring for hog, and cooking something the size of your ex-girlfriend
  is no trivial feat. </p>

  so, with a little swearing, much rousing of companions and a large pot of coffee,
  we get a fire going, and it's time to get the hog out of the fridge. Then there's
  the obligatory last-minute butchering. You see, to get a hog to lie flat across
  the grill, you've got to saw through the pelvic bone. For some reason, many
  people find this unsettling. Fortunately for these people, I have a healthy
  attitude to eating meat, and I'm quite happy staring dinner in the eye before
  taking a saw to it's nether regions. If anything, it helps one work up an appetite.
  Does tend to get blood and hog-gore all over one's tools, though... </p>
<p align="left">After the sawing, there's the basting. Take honey, cider and salt,
  and just kind of liberally smear them everywhere. Start off with the hog on
  its back, and fill the body cavity with honey and cider. You'll know it's enough
  when it starts leaking out of the hogs' mouth and nostrils. Again, some people
  find this unsettling but we mostly think it's rather cute. Once the innards
  are well and truly sozzled, flip the hog over and give it a cider back-rub...
  if you close your eyes at this point, you can almost imagine you're massaging
  a dead human. Kinda freaky. Finally, crowbar the f*cker's mouth open, jam an
  apple between it's teeth, pop on the hat and shades (very important), get a
  round of photographs, REMOVE hat and shades, and start a-roasting.</p>

  now follows about six hours of interminable waiting. Generally, the best way
  to deal with the waiting is to drink beer. Large quantities of beer. So much
  beer, in fact, that you start using it as furniture. Judging from the sheer
  mind-buggering quantities of Stella Artois we consumed over the course of the
  weekend, I'm considering applying for some sort of corporate sponsorship - or
  even just a small endorsement contract. You'll know when the hog's ready, because
  you should be able to drop a good-sized (ie. about two feet long) knife through
  it's back. The meat should cleave neatly, almost crumble, and people should
  smell the meat and start circling like drunken vultures. And the best part is,
  once you've served the first round of hog, you sling the happy piggy back on
  the fire and cook the rest of him - the bits buried deep inside the rump and
  shoulder, where only the bravest carnivores dare to venture.</p>

<p align="left">By filtering the visible light and shifting everything towards
  the warmer end of the spectrum, where the human eye is most sensitive, these
  glasses can magically transport the wearer to happy-land, where the beer goblin
  comes from. On Monday, when it was markedly less sunny and even rained at one
  point, Don became inseparable from the happy glasses and became violent if we
  tried to take them away.</p>

  I include this picture purely for the irony value. Read the T-shirt.</p>
<p align="left">Of course, it's inevitable that as beer and hog get consumed,
  the cameras become less and less likely to be pointing at the really interesting
  things that are going on, and we're forced to resort to something called 'memory'
  to try and work out what was going on. While the later part of the evening is
  hazy to say the least, I do vividly recall at one point sitting by the fire
  with Dave, picking hunks of juicy hog-flesh off the cooling carcass, when I
  noticed that the head appeared to be missing. A few moments later... no, it's
  not missing, it's upside-down and we're eating Hog Face. Rather nice though.</p>
<p align="left"><a href="fullsize/DCP01244.jpg"><img border="0" src="thumbs/DCP01244.jpg" width="300" height="225" align="right"></a>I
  think there were about ten of us around the fire that night... Jesus, for reasons
  best known to himself, slept wedged sideways in a camping sofa and breathed
  embers for most of the night. Don realised that the people in my bed were probably
  smaller than him, and sure enough the small people suddenly weren't in the bed
  any more. Gordon slept in a chair, and in the morning Kate went out for cigarettes
  and chocolate milk - a service for which we, the attending faithful, will be
  grateful in eternam.</p>
