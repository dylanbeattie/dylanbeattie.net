<h1>Thee Jubilee Hogge-Roaste</h1>
<h2>Episode 1: Saturday</h2>
<p class="preamble">(in which our intrepid heroes build a bar, dig a pit, buy a fridge, get drunk and pass out.)</p>
<hr>
<p><a href="fullsize/DCP01059.jpg"></a>There's anticipation in the streets, excitement 
  in the air and a pig in the fridge... yes, you join us for the third annual 
  hog-roast, on a bright clear Jubilee sunday morning. There's delightful sense 
  of the theatrical about walking into the butchers of a sunday morning and paying 
  a small fortune for a large dead thing wrapped in black bin-liners... like they've 
  cleaned and gutted your ex-wife for you or something. :)</p>
<p>In fact, considering the level of last night's festivities, it's astonishing 
  anyone's even alive... I vaguely remember eating biltong and drinking Becherovka 
  at about three this morning, and I distinctly recall that soul-destroying moment 
  when you finally decide to go to bed, walk out of the living room and realise 
  the sun's rising, the birds are singing and your body clock is about to get 
  fucked big-style. Everyone seems to have escaped rather lightly this time around.... 
  there's movement and consciousness from all quarters, which can only be a Good 
  Thing.</p>
<p>I take it as a good omen that for the first time, the weather is sufficiently 
  clement that we're actually having to refrigerate the hog... this did, it must 
  be said, involve throwing away quite a lot of food, but most of it went off 
  last year anyway so that's probably another Good Thing.</p>

<p>This time around, we were fortunate enough to have the services of a Qualified 
  Digger of Pits and Holes, who was also fool enough to dig the entire pit by 
  himself. Well done that man. And what a splendid pit, if I might say so.</p>
<p>There's this unwritten law that every party has to exceed it's predecessor 
  by an order of magnitude, in size, scale, ambition and just plain stupidity. 
  You see, if someone goes to two parties and they're the same, then they'll assume 
  they know what to expect of the next one... and where's the fun in that? We've 
  done cocktails, fancy dress, demolition of various forms, pyrotechnics, fireworks, 
  fire-breathing... but throughout all these endeavours, there's always been this 
  damned inconvenience of having to go to the fridge whenever a beverage is required. 
</p>
<p>And so it came to pass that, sitting outside one spring evening with very little 
  to do, the voices in my head suggest putting a bar on the site of the long-deceased 
  shed... (which is another party story for another time). One internet slippage 
  later, and we've got a rack of optics. A bit of improvisation, a bit of carpentry 
  and quite a lot of drilling later, and we've got something approaching a bar. 
  With nothing behind it. And then - surely a sign of divine endorsement if ever 
  such a thing existed - we head out to procure 'bar supplies' and they're selling 
  fridges. Little tiny branded fridges, with Stella Artois written on them. And 
  instructions in the manual that 'this fridge is not to be used for food or hot 
  beverages'. So naturally, we did what any self-respecting drinker would do in 
  the circumstances. We - or rather that nice Mister Visa person - bought a fridge. 
  You can see it here, happily chilling beers and purring quietly to itself. </p>

<p>Of course, having built the bar, it was necessary to test it - unleashing an
  untested bar onto our unsuspecting guests would be the <i>last</i> thing we'd
  want to do. After that, everything went a little bit hazy. </p>

<p>Rearrange these pictures so they tell a story. Go on. 'Cos we have <b>no</b>
  idea what the fuck was going on... although occasional nuggets of recollection
  drift to the surface, like the eyeballs in an ethnic soup... some truly outstanding
  bartending (although not by my bro, who sat there 'hard selling' people green
  drinks until he had to be physically removed), some truly extraordinary cocktails
  (including one which managed to go from red to blue without becoming purple
  at any point along the way), the invention of the 'Warhol' (above centre), the
  summoning of the Beer Goblin (top right), the cocktail mixer from hell (bottom
  left), some rather pointless games with foil, and my deciding that the bar would
  be a much better place to sleep than my bed, which was a good fifty feet away
  at this point...</p>
<p>And that's just the warm-up. Watch this space :)</p>
