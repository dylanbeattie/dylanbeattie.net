<p>I do interesting things with computers, code, comedy, music and video - then I travel all over the
    world and tell people about it. I've given keynote talks at software conferences on five
    continents, I invented a joke programming language that made it into Classic Rock magazine, and I
    own the <a href="http://ibless.therains.downin.africa/">best web address in the
        history of the internet</a>.</p>
