<p>I do interesting things with computers, code, comedy, music and video â€“ then I travel all over the
	world and tell people about it. I run <a href="https://ursatile.com">Ursatile</a>, a London-based software
	consultancy. I've given keynote talks at software conferences on four
	continents, I created <a href="https://codewithrockstar.com/">Rockstar</a>, a joke programming language that made it into Classic Rock magazine, and I
	own the <a href="http://ibless.therains.downin.africa/">best web address in the
		history of the internet</a>.</p>
