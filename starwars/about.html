<H2>About this Site</H2>
</DIV>
<P>
    <B>Update, January 2021:</B> Hello there, and welcome to a bona fide internet relic. This site was built in 1998. 
    When I wrote it, there were only three Star Wars movies. Napster was still a thing, iPods weren't invented yet, and Google didn't exist. This site was written 
    in TextPad running on Windows NT 4, tested in Netscape Navigator, and uploaded using command-line FTP.</p>
    <p>When I moved my website off my university account in 2001, I added a
     note saying "hey, I sort of lost interest in the whole POV-Ray thing, but I'll leave this online in case anybody's interested."</P>
     <P>When I <a href="https://dylanbeattie.net/2019/08/14/migrating-from-blogger-to-github-pages.html">gave dylanbeattie.net a complete overhaul in 2019</a>, I left this bit out. I honestly didn't
         think anybody would be looking at it over 20 years later.
     </P>
     <P>Well, turns out I was wrong. So it's back. Other than reinstating a couple of
         broken GIFs and adding this note, I haven't changed a thing; do a right-click, "view source" on these 
         pages and bask in the beauty of some properly old-school HTML from 1998.
     </P>
     <P>Have fun. I'll be back in 2041 to update this note. ;)</P>

<P>Since the release of <I>Star Wars: A New Hope</I> in 1977, there has been a tremendous amount of interest in the
characters, locations and technology of George Lucas' vision. From the original film's two sequels, <I>The Empire Strikes
Back</I> and <I>Return of the Jedi</I> to the spin-off novels, comics, computer games and even the commemorative Monopoly
set, Star Wars has inspired thousands of science-fiction fans the world over to make their own contributions to an
ever-expanding universe.</P>
<P>The Persistence of Vision raytracer is a program for generating photo-realistic computer images from text files
containing descriptions of 3D scenes or objects. It is available for most computer platforms, it is freely distributable,
and it can produce some stunning-looking images - take a look at <A HREF="http://www.povray.org">www.povray.org</A> for
more information and details of how to get hold of POV-Ray for your own computer.</P>
<P>I created this site in 1998, having put together a few SW models just for fun. Most of
the original models were mine, although there have been numerous contributions since this
site went 'live.' I haven't done anything in POV-Ray for years now - not enough time, and I kind
of lost interest after a while - but I had so many emails regarding this site that I felt it
was worth leaving it on-line, and I'll happily post SW POV-Ray stuff that other people have
developed.</P>
