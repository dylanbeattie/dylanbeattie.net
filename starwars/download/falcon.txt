MF.INC - Model description file for use with POV-Ray v3.1

************************
*** WORK IN PROGRESS ***
************************

This is one of those projects that got started and never got finished.

It's a complete POV-Ray v3.0+ model of the Millenium Falcon, and visually
it's probably about 90% there, but in terms of actual detail it's probably
more like 60-70% complete. The missing details are things like the
detail inside the access ports on the top and bottom of the ship - not 
obvious unless you're looking closely or from a particular angle, but it
should still be there. It was coded entirely by hand, from a large-scale
plastic model kit, and since it's been knocking around in this nearly-
completed state for over six months now, I thought I'd post the code
to the web and see if anyone wanted to finish it off... The current form
is usable from most angles, although you might see the odd missing detail
here and there.

Be warned, my code is probably almost unreadable - most #declared objects
have logical names, but my use of CSGs and so on is uncommented.

Good luck, and have fun.
