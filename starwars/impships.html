<H4>TIE Interceptor</H4>
<P>Original POV-Ray model by Dylan Beattie</P>
<P>The Sienar Fleet Systems TIE Interceptor, loosely based on the prototype flown by Darth
Vader at the Battle of Yavin in <I>Star Wars: A New Hope</I>. The model was written entirely
in POV-Ray, and incorporates several elements re-used from the TIE Fighter model. Dimensions
are from <A HREF="tools.html#tegtvav">'The Essential Guide to Vehicles and Vessels'</A>, the
colours and textures are from the reference photographs in <A
HREF="tools.html#chronicles">Star War: Chronicles</A></P>

<H4>TIE Defender</H4>
<P>Original POV-Ray model by Dylan Beattie</P>
<P>OK, so it's not in any of the films and it's a bit obscure, but it's a mean-looking piece
of hardware and it wasn't too difficult to put together, so here it is - the Sienar Fleet
Systems TIE Defender. Another one written completely in POV-Ray, and incorporating elements
from the other TIE models, the dimensions are based on 
<A HREF="tools.html#tegtvav">'The Essential Guide to Vehicles and Vessels'</A> and the
textures are a 'best guess' based on the other TIE vessels.</P>

<P>Original 3D mesh from <A HREF="http://www.surfthe.net/swma">Star Wars Modelling
Alliance</A><BR>
POV-Ray conversion and texturing by D M Beattie</P>
<P>The core of the Imperial Navy, first seen in the memorable opening shot of <I>Star Wars:
A New Hope</I> This model is actually a conversion of a wireframe mesh from the Star Wars
Modelling Alliance; however, when I checked back to see who the author of the original mesh
was, it had been replaced by an updated version, so if this is your work please let me know
if it's OK to keep it on here. The mesh was converted to POV-Ray using Keith Rule's <A
HREF="tools.html#crossroads">Crossroads 3D</A> utility, and then the textures and a few
other bits added by hand in POV-Ray. Up close it looks a little flat, but it looks great
looming in the background...</P>
