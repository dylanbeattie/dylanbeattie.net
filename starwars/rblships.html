<H4>Rebel Pilot</H4>
<P>Created by Hero Nguav<BR>
Editing by Howard Day</P>
<P>A remarkably complex model, this Rebel pilot includes the facility to move or rotate the arms, legs and head
independently into almost any posture. The colour of the flightsuit and visor can be redefined, and the 
file includes definitions for both male and female pilots. This one may take a little work to incorporate into
a scene, but it looks excellent.</P>
