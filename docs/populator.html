<h1>Dylan's Magic IE Form Populator</h1>
<p>Dylan Beattie, July 2003</p>
<hr>
<h2>What is it?</h2>
<p>When you're developing websites, testing things like registration forms
and survey forms can be a real pain in the arse - mainly because you have
to fill out the same form, over and over and over again. On long forms like
company registrations or new user sign-up forms, this process is not just
irritating, it's time-consuming as well.<br>
 </p>
<hr>
<h2>Disclaimer</h2>
<p>The steps described here involve editing the registry. This may cause Bad
Things to happen. If you lose your data, house, life or livelihood as a result
- your problem. I've done this, it works for me, and I find it incredibly
useful.</p>
<hr>
<h2>How It Works</h2>
<p>In a nutshell, right-click, select 'Form Populator' and it'll fill every field on the form.</p>
<div align="center"><img src="populator/screenshot.gif" width="800" height="600" vspace="10"/></div>
<hr>
<h2>How To Get It</h2>
<ol>
<li>Download (right-click and 'Save Target As...') <a href="populator/populate.htm" title="Right-click, 'Save Target As...'" >populate.htm</a> and save it into %WINDIR%\Web (C:\WINNT\Web on Windows NT/2000, C:\Windows\Web on Windows 95, 98, Me and XP)</li>
<li>Edit the downloaded file and follow the instructions at the top.</li>
<li>Download <a href="populator/populate.winnt.reg">populate.winnt.reg</a> if you're running Windows NT or 2000, or <a href="populator/populate.windows.reg">populate.windows.reg</a> if you're running Windows 95, 98, Me or XP. Double-click the file to import it into your registry.</li>
<small>(Note: If your Windows installation is somewhere other than C:\Winnt or C:\Windows, you'll need to get either of the registry files and edit it to suit your installation.)</small>
<li>Close and re-open Internet Explorer.</li>
</ol>
<p>That's all. You should now have a Form Populator option on your right-click menu.</p>
