<h1>Ten Reasons Why You Should Be Using JScript Instead Of VBScript </h1>
<p>VBScript is an interpreted scripting language, commonly used for writing websites based on Microsoft's Active Server Pages technology. Loosely based on the syntax of the popular Visual Basic programming langugage, VBScript is the <em>de facto</em> standard for ASP web development, probably due to the vast number of ASP books, tutorials and examples which use VBScript to teach and demonstrate principles of ASP programming.</p>
<p>JScript is the Microsoft implementation of the ECMA 262 language specification (ECMAScript Edition 3). With only a few minor exceptions (to maintain backwards compatibility), JScript is a full implementation of the ECMA standard. </p>
<ol id="reasons">
<li>J(ava)Script is Everywhere</li>
<p>The vast majority of modern Web browsers contain a Javascript interpreter. Javascript is another implementation of the ECMA standard - that means it's near as dammit the same language as JScript. I have non-trivial function libraries (MD5 hash algorithms, for example) that run on both the server and the client. If a client's using a modern browser with Javascript enabled, I can check passwords immediately. </p>
