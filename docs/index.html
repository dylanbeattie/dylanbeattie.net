<p class="alert">This stuff is all seriously old. But it's here because once in a while I want to look up how I did something 18 years ago, and

<p>A collection of notes and things I've written, which other people might find of use if they're trying to solve the same problems I did.</p>

<dt><a href="/docs/iis6_bare_linefeed.html">Bare Linefeeds Cause &quot;The connection was dropped by the remote host&quot; with Microsoft IIS 6 SMTP Service</a> (Dylan Beattie, July 2005)</dt>
<dd>This document describes a problem whereby certain e-mail messages were no longer being sent correctly from ASP pages after upgrading a web server from Windows 2000/IIS 5 to Windows 2003 Server and IIS 6. Affected messages would remain in the queue indefinitely, and an EventID 4006 &quot;Message delivery to the host '1.2.3.4' failed while delivering to the remote domain 'example.com' for the following reason: The connection was dropped by the remote host.&quot; would be created in the Windows event log. This is due to IIS6 allowing messages to be sent containing bare linefeed characters, which in turn cause certain remote mail servers, most notably qmail, to refuse delivery. </dd>
