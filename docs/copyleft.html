<h1>Copyleft: All Rights Reversed</h1>
<h2>Musings on a World Without Copyright</h2>
<h3>Dylan Beattie</h3>
One idea I've had about reforming copyright / IP law is this. Anything
can be freely copied, reused, modified, etc. - but only the original
creator is allowed to profit from it. In a nutshell - you can copy,
download, rip'n'burn Madonna CDs, but only Madonna is allowed to sell
them.<br>
<br>
This is *basically* how the music industry is working at the moment.
No-one in the western world actually *sells* bootleg music CDs any more
(do they?) - Napster et al. have basically ensured that you either buy
your music properly (whether from HMV, iTunes, whatever) or you just
download it. It seems to work. I still buy loads of CDs - sometimes
because they're too obscure to find on P2P networks; sometimes 'cos I
think they actually justify it (or that the band could really use the
money...), and sometimes just 'cos I'm walking past HMV and have a
moment of slippage. I may also have been known to download an
occasional MP3. Only once have I ever knowingly paid money for an
illegal copy of an audio CD, and that's 'cos I'd spent ten years trying
to find it and the guy in Germany who had it refused to part with the
original at any price. (And yes, it sucked)<br>
<br>
Literature would be fine. People who want to read stories will still
buy books - who the hell is going to print out their own downloaded
copy of the Da Vinci Code when you can buy it at the airport for a
fiver? The people who are researching or referencing books could get
downloadable, electronic copies of pretty much anything they wanted,
and copy/paste/search to their hearts' content.<br>
<br>
Scientific research is more complicated. There's a common argument that
patents are necessary for pharmaceutical companies to benefit from
their research - if Glaxo discover an AIDS cure, they'll be looking to
recoup the tens of millions of dollars they've spent researching it by
*selling* that vaccine to sick rich people. If anyone could download
the recipe off the internet and (with the right facilities and
training) make their own AIDS cure - would that be a good thing?
Short-term, it means that everyone gets their AIDS cure at cost - no
more ten-thousand-dollar shots for rich American bankers who really
wish they hadn't gone whoring in Thailand on their last trip abroad.
Long-term, either Glaxo et al will find some other way to cover their
costs (good) or they go bankrupt, drug research stagnates permanently
and we all die of some new strain of Chinese bird-flu. Discuss.<br>
<br>
The biggest problem is software, because software has no value beyond
it's digital representation. Open source is one approach to this - but
frankly, it has a *long* way to go and there are areas where I don't
think the current paradigm will ever work. Consider accountancy
software. It's dull as arse. No-one is *ever* going to write an
open-source replacement for Quicken for fun. They might do it for
money, or to win a bet, but it's not something that geeks sit down and
go "hey, I'm bored, I'm going to write some accountancy software." When
you include the fact that it has to be rewritten every year to take new
legislation and tax rules into account, you end up with a big horrible
moving target that just won't die. Without the mechanisms of copyright
and patents, there is no way for Quicken to protect their investment -
all it takes is for one person to buy a single copy and stick it up on
the web, and every other user in the world downloads that copy for free.<br>
<br>
Perhaps a system whereby, instead of Quicken writing the software and
*then* selling it, they sell it up front? Go to every company who uses
it and say "look, give us some cash or we're not writing another
version". Faced with a choice between coughing up the cash or risking
having to find another software vendor by the start of the next
financial year... well, you decide.<br>
<br>
Before you laugh, this has worked for music. Marillion wrote, recorded
and mastered their last album by selling it in advance. 15,000 fans
paid ten quid each for an album that hadn't even been written yet. The
band took that &pound;150K, rented a studio, recorded the album, and
then went to EMI and negotiated a distribution deal. The band retained
control of the rights, so if they decide to make the whole thing
available as a free download, no-one can stop them. Not EMI, not the
RIAA, not the BPA, no-one. Chroma Key did exactly that. The first
Chroma Key album was self-financed and Kevin Moore (who basically is
Chroma Key) retained all the copyrights. When sales of that album had
died down, the whole thing was put on the web as a free download in the
hope it would boost sales of the next one.<br>
<br>
If Peter Jackson asked you for &pound;10 to make "The Hobbit", on the
understanding that when it was finished, you could download it for free
if you didn't want to pay &pound;10 for a cinema ticket or &pound;20
for a DVD - would you pay? What if the movie sucked? Would you feel
cheated? More or less cheated than the time you actually *bought* "The
Tailor of Panama" on DVD? Or paid to see Van Helsing at the cinema?<br>
<br>
What about if Valve wanted &pound;35 in advance for Half-life 3? What
about Duke Nukem Forever, for that matter? We've all paid for games
that turned out so bad&nbsp; we only played them for five minutes...
(Test Drive 6 springs to mind.) What about if you'd paid for a game so
bad it never got released?<br>
<br>
Think about your job. If you're a plumber, you're probably OK.
B&amp;Q's website is full of datasheets on how to fix your own toilet,
install your own shower, etc. Plumbers make very good money from people
who have found out the hard way that there's more to plumbing than a
B&amp;Q datasheet. If you're an independent musician without a record
deal, you're probably already broke and starving, so no change there,
then. If you're Britney Spears, that Playboy offer is going to start
looking more and more attractive when you realise that kids would
rather get your music off the internet and spend their pocket money on
designer clothes and fast food. <br>
