<h1>Dylan's Magic IE Form Populator</h1>

<p>Dylan Beattie, August 2002</p>

<hr>
<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>When you're developing websites, testing things like registration forms
and survey forms can be a real pain in the arse - mainly because you have
to fill out the same form, over and over and over again. On long forms like
company registrations or new user sign-up forms, this process is not just
irritating, it's time-consuming as well.<br>
 </p>

<p>This page outlines an automatic form populator tool for Internet Explorer,
based on some cunning JavaScript and a bit of registry hacking.<br>
 </p>

<hr>
<h2>Disclaimer</h2>

<p>The steps described here involve editing the registry. This may cause Bad
Things to happen. If you lose your data, house, life or livelihood as a result
- your problem. I've done this, it works for me, and I find it incredibly
useful.&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<h2>How It Works</h2>
 Internet Explorer 4 and above allow you to define <a
 href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/workshop/browser/ext/tutorials/context.asp">custom
context menus</a>. This is mainly used by developers for things like the IE
Web Tools, but you can also define your own personalised context menus. Here,
we implement a context menu-based tool that will automatically fill all the
empty fields on a web form.<br>
