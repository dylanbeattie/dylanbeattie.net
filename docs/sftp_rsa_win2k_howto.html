<h1>Secure FTP with RSA Authentication Using OpenSSH v3.4-1 on Windows 2000</h1>
<p>Dylan Beattie, July 2002</p>
<hr>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>This document outlines how to use the OpenSSH tools to create a secure file
  transfer mechanism which can be automated via shell scripts or batch files.
  One application of this - the thing we're using it for - is to allow our clients
  to automate the data transfer process from their sales mainframe to our web
  servers, without any danger of the information contained therein being compromised
  in transit. In a nutshell; at eight every night, their mainframe spits out a
  fresh batch of sales figures; at nine every night, this is automatically uploaded
  to our server via SFTP using RSA authentication, and at midnight, our server
  picks up the fresh data from the upload directory and imports it into the database.
  This document describes how we set up the middle stage of this process - installing
  OpenSSH and configuring it to allow secure, unattended file transfer operations.
</p>
<ol>
  <li>The OpenSSH server is installed on the web server.</li>
  <li>The OpenSSH client tools are installed on the remote machine(s).</li>
  <li>An RSA key pair is generated at each client machine</li>
  <li>The public key from each of these key pairs is sent to the server and added to the list of authorised keys.</li>
</ol>
<p>These examples are based on a fictional Windows 2000 Server called <code>fortress</code>,
  with the fully-qualified internet hostname <code>www.fortress.com</code>. This
  machine is not part of a Windows NT domain, but is configured as a stand-alone
  server, and we've created a local Windows user account called <code>johndoe</code>.
</p>
<pre>Command transcripts are shown in monospaced type, with the bits you type shown in <b>bold</b></pre>
<p>These examples are tested and verified for OpenSSH v3.4-1 running on Windows 2000 Server, and have been tested using both the Windows and Linux versions of the OpenSSH client utilities. Other version/platform combinations may or may not work as described here.</p>

<h2>Disclaimer</h2>
<p>I'm by no means a security expert, and I'm not an OpenSSH guru. If you find these notes helpful, great - if you don't, there's plenty of more detailed resources out there which <b>will</b> answer your questions if you take the time to read them properly. Contributions and testimonials are welcome; questions will be read and possibly answered but I'm making no guarantees, and please don't rely on this information for anything important. I don't know whether it's the most secure or most effective way of doing this, but it works and that's good enough for me. If it's not good enough for you, don't use it :)</p>

<h2>Walkthrough</h2>
<h3>Install OpenSSH on the WWW server</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Get OpenSSH from <a href="http://www.networksimplicity.com/openssh/">http://www.networksimplicity.com/openssh/</a>.
    Run the installer, accepting all default options.These instructions assume
    OpenSSH has been installed to C:\Program&nbsp;Files\NetworkSimplicity\</li>
  <li>Check Windows file/folder permissions, and make sure the local user <code>johndoe</code> has Full Control of the C:\Program&nbsp;Files\NetworkSimplicity\ssh\ directory and all it's sub-directories, otherwise you'll get odd 'Access Denied' messages when you try to upload the public key files later.
  <li>Configure the passwd and group files within the OpenSSH configuration as
    follows. Here, we create an entry for the local user 'fortress', and a standard
    local group file. If you're setting up domain users or inter-domain trust
    relationships, consult the documentation.

C:\Program&nbsp;Files\NetworkSimplicity\ssh&gt;<b>mkgroup -l &gt;&gt; ..\etc\group</b>
</pre>
  </li>
  <li>Type <code><b>net start opensshd</b></code> at the command line to start
    the server</li>
</ol>
<h3>Install OpenSSH on the client workstation</h3>
<h2></h2>
<ol>
  <li>Get OpenSSH from <a href="http://www.networksimplicity.com/openssh/">http://www.networksimplicity.com/openssh/</a>.
    Run the installer, selecting only the client tools. These instructions assume
    OpenSSH has been installed to c:\Program&nbsp;Files\networksimplicity\</li>
  <li>From the command line, verify that you can connect to the server using ssh
    [ssh syntax is <code>ssh username@host</code>] - here, I connect and then
    run the <code>hostname</code> command just to make sure I'm connected to the
    right place :) You may be warned that the server's identity cannot be verified

</pre>
    This confirms that the server is accessible and correctly configured, and
    that the client tools are installed correctly on the client workstation. </li>
</ol>
<h3>Configure the server to allow RSA key-pair authentication</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Find the <code>sshd_config</code> file on the server (ours is in C:\Program&nbsp;Files\NetworkSimplicity\ssh), and check the following lines exist:<br>
    <code><br>
    Protocol 2,1</code> (default is <code>Protocol 2</code>)<br>
    <code><br>
    RSAAuthentication Yes </code>(default is <code>RSAAuthentication no</code>)<br>
  </li>
</ol>
<h3>Create a key pair on the client and export the public key to the server</h3>
<p>Here we use ssh-keygen.exe to create a 1024-bit RSA key pair. The
  private key stays on the client machine and must be kept safe - if this key
  is compromised, the security of the system is compromised. The public key is
  exported to the server, where it must be appended to the file <code>C:\Program&nbsp;Files\NetworkSimplicity\ssh\.ssh\authorized_keys
  </code>(Note that on a newly-installed server, this file may be blank or non-existent.)</p>
<p>The following session transcript demonstrates the entire process, via SSH tools
  from the client machine.</p>
<p>First, we run ssh-keygen specifying an RSA key type. <b>NOTE</b>: Supply an
  EMPTY passphrase, otherwise you'll be asked to type the passphrase whenever
  you use the key - which is not really what we want. </p>
<pre>
C:\Program&nbsp;Files\NetworkSimplicity\ssh><b>ssh-keygen.exe -t rsa</b>
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/bin/.ssh/id_rsa): <b>johndoe.key</b>
johndoe.key already exists.
Overwrite (y/n)? <b>y</b>
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
Enter same passphrase again:
Your identification has been saved in <b>johndoe.key</b>.
Your public key has been saved in johndoe.key.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
ec:30:03:39:06:96:9f:a7:15:ed:4a:2e:de:64:bc:14 Dylan Beattie@DYLAN_PC</pre>
<p>This has created two files - a file called<b> <code>johndoe.key</code> </b>containing
  your private key, and a file called <code><b>johndoe.key.pub</b></code> containing
  the public key.</p>
<p>The private key needs to be moved into the <code>c:\Program&nbsp;Files\networksimplicity\ssh\.ssh:</code></p>
<code>C:\Program&nbsp;Files\NetworkSimplicity\ssh><b>move johndoe.key .ssh</b></code>
<p>The public key must first be copied to the corresponding <code>.ssh</code>
  directory on the server (done here using SFTP):</p>
<pre>
C:\Program&nbsp;Files\NetworkSimplicity\ssh><b>sftp johndoe@www.fortress.com</b>
Connecting to www.fortress.com...
johndoe@www.fortress.com's password:
sftp> <b>cd .ssh</b>
sftp> <b>put johndoe.key.pub</b>
Uploading johndoe.key.pub to /bin/.ssh/johndoe.key.pub
sftp> <b>exit</b>
</pre>
<p>...and then we connect via SSH and append the contents of the fortress.pub file to the authorized_keys file in the .ssh directory.</p>
<pre>

</pre>
<p>That's it. We're now ready to test our RSA authentication.</p>
<h3>Test the RSA Authentication</h3>
<p>We can now connect by specifying the filename of our private key on the command
  line, rather than supplying a password as part of the connection process. This
  means that <b>anyone who has your private key can assume your identity and compromise
  your server.</b> So be careful with it.</p>
<p>To establish an SSH connection using RSA authentication, specify the location
  of the private key file with the -i option.</p>
<pre>C:\Program&nbsp;Files\NetworkSimplicity\ssh&gt;<b>ssh -i .ssh\johndoe.key johndoe@www.fortress.com</b>

Microsoft Windows 2000 [Version 5.00.2195]
(C) Copyright 1985-2000 Microsoft Corp.</pre>
<pre>(fortress) C:\Program&nbsp;Files\NetworkSimplicity\ssh&gt;<b>exit</b>
Connection to www.fortress.com closed.</pre>
<pre>C:\Program&nbsp;Files\NetworkSimplicity\ssh&gt;</pre>
<p>To establish a Secure FTP connection (SFTP) using RSA authentication, use the
  -oIdentityFile option:</p>
<pre>C:\Program&nbsp;Files\NetworkSimplicity\ssh&gt;<b>sftp -oIdentityFile=.ssh\johndoe.key johndoe@www.fortress.com</b>
   Connecting to www.fortress.com...
   sftp&gt;
</pre>
<p>And there you have it - a secure FTP connection created without specifying
  a password.</p>
<h3>Creating a batch SFTP script</h3>
<p>Using the <code>-b</code> switch, <code>sftp </code>can run a sequence of commands
  from a batch file rather than as an interactive session. Here, we're going to
  write a batch script that will connect, upload a set of files from <code>C:\EXPORT\</code>
  on the local machine (our workstation) to <code>W:\ftproot\upload\</code> on
  our server. This also demonstrates something called <b>CygDrive</b> notation
  - Cygnus' (and OpenSSH's) way of accessing Windows drive letters in a Unix-style
  environment. </p>
<p>First, create the file <code>c:\export\nightly_upload.ftp</code> (or whatever
  you want to call it) - which should look something like:</p>
<pre>put /cygdrive/c/export/prices.csv /cygdrive/w/ftproot/upload/prices.csv
put /cygdrive/c/export/offers.csv /cygdrive/w/ftproot/upload/offers.csv
put /cygdrive/c/export/accounts.csv /cygdrive/w/ftproot/upload/accounts.csv
</pre>
<p>Note how we're using <code>/cygdrive/c/</code> to denote drive <code>C:\ </code>on
  the local machine, and <code>/cygdrive/w/</code> to denote drive <code>W:\ </code>on
  the remote machine.</p>
<p>Then create the Windows batch file that will call SFTP with the appropriate
  arguments - note the <code>PROGRA~1</code> shorthand for <code>Program&nbsp;Files</code>
  to get around potential problems with pathnames containing spaces. The contents
  of <code>upload.bat</code> look like this - and should be all on one line:</p>
<pre>c:\progra~1\networksimplicity\ssh\sftp.exe -oIdentityFile=c:\progra~1\networksimplicity\ssh\.ssh\johndoe.key -b c:\export\nightly_upload.ftp johndoe@www.fortress.com</pre>
<p>Note that we're using fully-qualified path names throughout - advanced users,
  feel free to use the 'Start in Folder...' feature of the Task Scheduler or other
  means to make this look a bit more elegant, but this syntax is most reliable.
</p>
<p>Finally, use the Windows Task Scheduler to run <code>upload.bat</code> at 21:00
  every night (or whenever), and you're in business. </p>
