summary: |
  Public speaking can be terrifying – but it can also be a really effective way to share your ideas, inspire your teams, and develop your career as a technologist.

  This is a one-day workshop about how to create, refine and deliver great technical talks at conferences and technology meetups. It’s around 50% presentation and classroom-style training, and 50% collaboration and hands-on sessions.  By the end of the day all of the attendees will have created and prepared two short (3-minute) talks, received some suggestions and audience feedback.

> There were, genuinely, so many little moments where my mind was blown during Dylan’s workshop. I wish I had written all of it down, to better be equipped to share all of it.

## Schedule and content:

### Kick off

* Intro and welcome. Who is everybody and what are they hoping to get out of the event?
* What makes a great talk? 

### How to Design a Talk

* Collecting ideas, brainstorming, structures
* Classic talk structures – the narrative, the ’top ten’ list, the three-act play
* Pacing and timing – how do you know how much content to prepare?

### Breakout session: Design A Talk. 

Prepare a three-minute talk on any subject you like - without using any slides. You're going to stand up and talk for three minutes, and everybody's going to watch – and yeah, if you've not done it before, it can be pretty scary. But it gets easier – I promise :)

### Presentation 1

Everybody delivers their three-minute talks - depending on numbers we may split into groups for this part of the session. 

After each presentation, we'll ask the rest of the group to share two pieces of feedback - one thing they liked, and one suggestion for improving the talk.

### LUNCH

### Understanding your audience

* How to pitch a talk.
* Etiquette and codes of conduct
* Using humour
* Dealing with feedback (here we’ll use the compliment/suggestion card feedback from the morning sessions)
* How to do a good Q&A


### Slides and Visuals

* Why use slides, anyway?
* Tips and tricks
* Working with technical content
* Advanced Powerpoint
* Copyright and fair use

### Presenting Technical Content

* Pros and cons of live coding demos
* How to present diagrams and technical detail

###	Breakout: prepare a talk with slides

* Three minutes to TEACH THE AUDIENCE SOMETHING TECHNICAL
* Could be the same as earlier; could be something else.
* Use slides, diagrams, animation or whatever you want to.

###	Presentations 2

* Split into groups again (6 people each)
* Deliver your talk, watch five others; same feedback – one green, one blue
* Follow-up discussion – how did it go? Review feedback.

### Practical Tips and Disaster Recovery

* How to prepare for the things you can’t prepare for
* Preparation timelines and coping mechanisms
* Speaker horror stories (and why they weren’t that bad after all!)

### Discussion, Q&A and wrap up

### Audience and Prerequisites

This workshop is aimed at anybody who wants to improve their public speaking and presentation skills. As part of the workshop, you'll be preparing and delivering a short presentation using slides, so you'll need to bring a laptop with Powerpoint, KeyNote or Google Slides running on it.

The ideal class size for this workshop is between six and 20 people – if you'd like to run it for a smaller or a larger group, please get in touch and let's chat.
