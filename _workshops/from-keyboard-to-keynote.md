testimonials:
  - I loved Dylan's energy and passion. I also took away loads of practical ways to improve my speaking skills.
  - I've done speaker training type things in the past so the material was not really new, but Dylan's way of presenting it is just SO MUCH better than previous training sessions.
  - I really enjoyed the humour and that Dylan showed personality throughout the workshop.
  - Really engaging, and the participation element was enough to practice but not too much to feel overwhelmed

## Workshop Overview 

Speaking in front of an audience, whether in person or online, can be daunting -- but it doesn't have to be.

Dylan Beattie has delivered keynote presentations at conferences all over the world: NDC, JFokus, BuildStuff, DotNext, YOW!, and many more. In this 2-day workshop, Dylan will teach you everything he knows about how to create and deliver great presentations for technical audiences, whether you're speaking at industry conferences, doing a talk at your local meetup group, or just sharing ideas with your own team.

On day 1, we'll focus on structure and presentation. You'll learn how to design a talk - yes, great presentation don't just magically appear out of nowhere. Like any other product, success starts with design. Gather ideas, create a structure, figure out what works. You need to understand your constraints: format, time limits, what kind of audience you'll be speaking to. You need to understand the tools you can use: language, storytelling, humour, rhetoric. We'll learn about how to rehearse effectively: how do you actually make sure you're getting better each time, instead of just repeating the same mistakes over and over? Even seasoned presenters get nervous before a talk - so how do you deal with nerves?

We'll look at some examples of great - and not-so-great - presenters, figure out what makes them work, and talk about what we can do to incorporate those ideas and techniques into our own presentations. Then we'll put what we've learned into action: everybody in the group will prepare and present a short talk - just words, no slides - on a topic of their choice.

On day 2, we'll concentrate on visual material --  slides, multimedia, and live demos. We'll look at techniques you can use to make your presentations clear, accessible and engaging, and how to use images, animation and photography to support and reinforce the points you're making in your presentation. We'll look at tips for presenting code, the challenges of doing live demos, and how to use screen recording and video editing to take your live code presentations to the next level.

Then on the afternoon of day 2, everybody will prepare and deliver another short presentation -- this time using slides, multimedia and/or live demos, depending on their choice of topic.

The workshop wraps up with tips for disaster recovery and dealing with unforeseen problems, and there's plenty of time throughout the workshop for discussion and questions.

* Tips and tricks
* Working with technical content
* Advanced PowerPoint
* Copyright and fair use

### Presenting Technical Content

* Pros and cons of live coding demos
* How to present diagrams and technical detail
* Working with videos and screen recordings

### Practical Tips and Disaster Recovery

* How to prepare for the things you can’t prepare for
* Preparation timelines and coping mechanisms
* Speaker horror stories (and why they weren’t that bad after all!)

### Discussion, Q&A and wrap up

## Target Audience and Prerequisites

This workshop is suitable for anybody who is looking to begin public speaking, or to improve their presentation technique.

Around 25% of the workshop is specifically focused on presenting software code and technology; the rest of the workshop is applicable to presentations on any topic and to any kind of audience.

Attendees will need a laptop and a presentation tool. I recommend Microsoft PowerPoint -- most examples are presented in PowerPoint, and the course includes some specific discussion around using PowerPoint for creating animation effects and slide transitions -- but for the attendee presentations element of the workshop, Keynote or a web-based solution will work just fine.
