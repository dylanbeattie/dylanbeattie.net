<strong>{{ page.summary }}</strong>

Since .NET 5, Microsoft has shipped a new release of .NET and C# every year, adding a steady stream of features and capabilities to the world's most powerful development platform (yeah, I said it!)

With .NET 10 and C# 14 in 2025, we've got a host of new C# language features to play with - from "extension everything", a new syntax for adding extension properties, methods, static members and even user-defined operators to existing classes, to new features supporting native compilation and AOT for smaller binaries and faster deployments, to file-based apps that let you run .cs files directly, and much more.

This workshop is aimed at experienced .NET developers who want to get hands-on with everything that's new and shiny in .NET 10. We'll be sharing code throughout using GitHub and VS LiveShare, you'll go home with a fully working copy of the sample application, and all the workshop code is published under the MIT license so you can use it for whatever you like.
