**Most developers have heard of the architectural style known as REST, but even experienced developers often find it difficult to apply RESTful principles when building real-world applications. This workshop is all about building and running RESTful systems in the real world.**

Over two days, you'll get a comprehensive grounding in the principles and patterns behind HTTP APIs, the architectural style known as REST, and the frameworks and formats that exist to support developers building HTTP APIs using C# and Microsoft .NET. We'll start by going right back to Roy Fielding's original thesis "Architectural Styles and the Design of Network-based Software Architectures", in which he describes the set of constraints that define this much-misunderstood architectural style. We'll learn the significance of each of these constraints, and explore some examples of real-world systems that demonstrate each constraint in action.

We'll look in depth at how to use Microsoft .NET to build and host high-performance REST APIs. We'll discuss how running on .NET  opens up new possibilities for developing and hosting your APIs, from cross-platform IDEs like Rider and Visual Studio Code, to running .NET Core on Linux and using serverless hosting environments like AWS Lambda. We'll explore the various formats that exist for representing hypermedia resources in JSON -- HAL, SIREN, HYDRA, JSON-LD and Collection+JSON, and the relative merits of each. We'll go beyond `200 OK` and `404 Not Found` and explore how you can use the full range of HTTP verbs, headers and response codes to build expressive, responsive APIs. We'll look at ways of securing your HTTP APIs, and techniques and patterns you can use to document and test your APIs in development, and monitor them when they're running in production.

Finally, to put all this in context, we'll talk about why REST might not always be the best solution to your problem, look briefly at some of the alternative API patterns you may want to consider using, and finish up with some discussion of how RESTful services can fit into your organisation's technology strategy - and how to persuade your boss, and your team, that they're worth investing in.

You'll leave the workshop with a comprehensive understanding of building HTTP APIs in C# and .NET, your own working implementations of the patterns and techniques we've talked about, and a much clearer idea of what REST is - and why people are still talking about it, nearly twenty years after it was first defined.

## Key Takeaways

* Learn how to design and implement RESTful APIs in C# and .NET
* Learn how to use the full range of HTTP verbs and response codes effectively.
* Learn about the various hypermedia formats that are available for building HTTP APIs.
* Learn about the rich set of tools that can help you design, build and manage your APIs.

## Target Audience and Prerequisites

This course is aimed at developers who have some experience building web sites and applications using C# and Microsoft .NET.

The workshop is run fully online, using Zoom and various online collaboration tools. Attendees will be writing and running .NET code during the workshop, so will need to join the workshop on a computer running Windows, macOS or Linux, and install the Microsoft .NET SDK from [dotnet.microsoft.com/download](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download).

The ideal class size for this workshop is between 6–20 people. If you’d like to run it for a smaller or a larger group, please get in touch and let’s chat.
